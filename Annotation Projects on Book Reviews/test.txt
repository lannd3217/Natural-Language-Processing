213	adjudicated	good	"How I love Carnal!!   Just when I thought another Kristen Ashley hero could not break my heart any more than her earlier heroes, along comes Deke Hightower. A loner, almost a recluse, a man of very few words (the original strong, silent type!), Deke has had a hard, tough life, never putting down roots anywhere and never, ever opening his heart to a woman. He is a simple man, a lover of his bike and the open road, which he makes VERY clear to everyone he meets. Deke and Justice have a history together (he just doesn't remember it!!) but when they meet again years later, they have a verrrry slow build-up, and the slow burn worked perfectly for these two. There are lots of misunderstandings, lots of miscommunications, but when these two get together....OMG!!!! Expect the usual HAWTNESS and over-the-top Alpha-male sexiness that is pure Kristen Ashley.   One of the things I absolutely adored about this book was Deke. He is no kid (and neither is Justice), and Kristen Ashley describes him as all man and then some.   ""...All of it covering exceptional pecs and the most amazing stomach I'd ever seen.   Not abs.   A manly stomach.   I had to admit, I was over the cut leanness that was all the rage. In the beginning, it was hot. But now it seemed daunting, men being so developed they didn't have an inch of extra flesh on them, not like they were human beings but like they were diagrams of a body's muscularity.   Not Deke.""   *FAINTS* And Justice, I loved her! She is a gifted musician, with a renowned family but with lots and lots of heartache to go along with that. But this is Carnal and she is trying to hide out and get some peace. She hires Deke to renovate her new house and I think that Kristen Ashley must have a second secret career as a contractor. At first I thought there was too much detail about the house renovations but then I fell in love with the wonderful detail. Deke works with his hands, he takes pride in his work and the contrast between his blue-collar background and Justice's upbringing is both perfect and poignant at the same time. She has plenty of craziness to deal with, which Deke doesn't get at first. He really closes off his heart and Justice at first hides the fact that she remembers him from years before. He is almost sullen, but all of it comes from a place of heartbreak.   ""My life, babe,"" he shook his head, ""until I was about twenty, it was not good."" ""Okay,"" I prompted carefully, not liking that. ""And because a' that, I got a way I gotta be and that's a way that's not gonna change.""   >   All Justice wants is love and acceptance and some peace in her life. I loved that she was always herself around Deke, and eventually he warmed up to her cheerfulness, honesty and just plain goodness. It is difficult for a man like Deke to be with a brilliant and successful woman like Justice. But Deke, being Deke, accepts this in his own way.   He squatted and reached into the bag.   ""Open a beer for me, yeah?""   ""I live to serve.""   Deke wanted to test that but do it when they were both naked.   Fuck him.   Total dumbfuck.   I must mention that FANTASTIC cast of secondary characters here. Each and every one felt fully developed and essential to the story. In my opinion, Kristen Ashley can pretty much write about anything and I will devour it. But when she writes about two people who have already lived a full life, who have their own demons and pasts, and who know what they want, well, to me that's a winner. Welcome back to Carnal, folks, it is a beautiful place. Enjoy the bounty.   ""I was living it and all I had to do was take care of it, nurture it, make it stronger.   Then it always would be mine.   Everything I'd ever wanted.   My place in this universe.   And it felt amazing.""   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
296	adjudicated	good	"I kept my eyes closed. I couldn't bear for him to see what mine must look like. Desperate. Yearning. Drowning in agony.   Yearning and desperation. Two feelings perfectly conveyed by the author in Deep Blue Eternity. I can't stop thinking about this book! A beautifully written, haunting story of two very lost souls, Natasha Boyd also injects some much-needed humor and a whole lot of sexy into this magnificent book.   Livvy has run away to her grandmother's old island cottage and is quite shocked to find a caretaker named Tom living there. They begin a tentative and uneasy living situation but of course there is much more than meets the eye here. They are both frightened in their own way, both trying to escape brutal and heartbreaking pasts off the coast of South Carolina. Both are harbouring some very, very sad secrets and both are seeking healing, maybe in each others' arms. But Tom pushes Livvy away, she is very young and he cannot tell her why he is keeping her at a distance.   ""I mean, I thought we had a... a friendship or something, and I don't understand what I've done wrong."" Addressing it made a weird emotional bubble grow in my chest, and my eyes started to sting.   Livvy tries to begin a new life by finding a job at a local cafe and befriending the residents. But Tom battles his true feelings for her and settles on a friendship, as well as protecting her from the local bad boys.   ""Lifting my arms tentatively, I slid them around his waist. I thought I felt him shudder. His muscles were bunched tight, or he was tense. I didn't know. He was hugging me. I could hug him back, right?""   This book tackles some highly sensitive subjects which are handled with great care and sensitivity by Ms. Boyd. This is a moody, sexy, very emotional story that is perfectly written and entrancing. Do not miss Deep Blue Eternity! It is one of my favorite reads so far this year."

I absolutely love the tattooed and pierced Hayden and Tenley very much grew on me by the end of this story.   I have not yet read the prequel novella, Cupcakes & Ink, but I will now run to read it. I will admit that the first part of this book was a ""slow burn"" for me, there was no rushing into romance but instead Ms. Hunting slowly reveals the badly damaged souls of Hayden and Tenley. But then WOW, the author writes some amazingly hot sex scenes, which are very much infused with love and caring and an emotional connection between the characters. Hayden and Tenley both have secrets they are afraid to share with each other, even though it becomes clear they are falling in love.   Hayden is seriously hot and really tries to show his vulnerable side to Tenley. But she is both emotionally and physically scarred and keeps pushing him away.   ""Everyone has scars, Tenley. If we're lucky, they're only on the outside."" Hayden   I ended up falling in love with both these characters by the end and I can't wait for the next book in this series! Inked Armour will be released May 13th so I can get more of my Hayden fix.   (ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley in return for an honest review.)"
252	adjudicated	excellent	"How do you describe the feeling that you get when you read a Kristen Ashley book? It is very hard to describe the emotions in simple words. Gut-wrenching? Heart-pounding? All of those happen to me and when a book is the end of a beloved series, well, let's just say that I was a sobbing mess while reading this Epilogue.   I binge read The 'Burg Series several years ago while on a long vacation that involved a lot of driving. Needless to say, I volunteered to sit in the back seat while on most of this vacation so I could read this fantastic series! As with all of her books, each of Ms. Ashley's series are slightly different; in the 'Burg, the characters are all a little older, a lot jaded, fiercely protective, and above all, unforgettable.   HOLD ON is a spectacular end to the series. Cher appeared earlier in the series, a hard-luck woman who struggles to keep her head above water and lives paycheck-to-paycheck to support herself and her beloved son. She never, ever believes that love will happen for her, and never, ever believes that she will find happiness with a man who will love and cherish her and her son. Cher broke my heart over and over, and I cried many times throughout this book at her sadness and despair.   ""But he'd never give me what I wanted.   I forgot.   I forgot that I wasn't the kind of girl who got what she wanted.   Not once.   Not in my whole f*g life.   Yeah, I'd forgotten that.""   Cher has a major case of unrequited love for Garrett (Merry), who in turn cannot forget the ex-wife who broke his heart. Sounds like a real downer of a book, right? But no! HOLD ON is a tale of mended hearts, beautiful possibilities and bright futures that everyone dreams about in their heart of hearts. There is no one who can infuse a story with magnificence and hope like Ms. Ashley. And HOLD ON is the perfect story of love and redemption, of fighting for what you want, and for holding on when you know you have goodness within your grasp.   The ending of this book very much reminded me of the series finale of one of my favorite TV shows, Six Feet Under. Kristen Ashley is the Queen of epilogues and I will never, ever forget this one. I am so sad to say goodbye to the families of the 'Burg but I know that Ms. Ashley has even more goodness in store for her readers. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

489	adjudicated	average	5+++ stars!!!   I cannot get enough of Pam Godwin's books. Deliver is another deliciously dark and sexy book, which will sicken, stun, surprise and arouse you.   I could not put this book down. Forget what you think will happen in this book, because the author will totally surprise you with the characters and the plot. No one is all bad, and no one is all good. Yes, I even felt a little sympathy for Van, in all his f****d-up glory. Deliver is a perfectly written, dark thriller, with everything I love in a book: emotionally-connected characters, an incredibly twisted storyline, and scorching hot sex scenes.   Deliver is a must-read for fans of dark romance. I did not want this book to end, and I can't wait to read more from Ms. Godwin!!   (Copy provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
487	adjudicated	good	"Oh. My. God. What took me so long to read these books? LOVE this series!   Remember When 2 takes place almost a decade after high school and everyone has gone their own way. Layla is a journalist and finds herself in a position to interview Trip, who has gone on to become a major Hollywood star. She has never forgotten Trip but assumes he has moved on with his life. In fact, she is engaged to a seemingly perfect guy.   ""Trip Wilmington had been a gorgeous teenaged boy, no question. But Trip Wiley was a gorgeous young man exuding raw, unabashed sex at every turn.""   Even though so much time has passed, Trip and Layla pick up their easy friendship right away. They have a lot of shared history together and Trip feels comfortable in Layla's presence. Their undeniable physical attraction is there, too, but will it be enough for both of them to face the truth about their feelings for each other?   The author kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading this book. Would Layla and Trip get a chance to correct their past actions? This is an absolutely amazing, witty and emotional book and I don't want to give away any of the spectacular plot here. Suffice it to say my heart stopped a few times while reading, and I am not sure I can recover from the serious book hangover! This series has become one of my all-time favorites. Read it so you can fall in love with Trip and Layla, too!"
304	adjudicated	excellent	"4.5 - 5 Sexy - Sweet Stars!!   Hello, Elle Kennedy! Thank you for this perfect blend of sexy, sweet and funny! The Deal is a palate cleanser, the kind of book that is a refreshing change of pace from dark, angsty, over-emotional stories. Even if you are not usually a fan of college romances, take a chance on The Deal, you won't be disappointed. Hannah is a smart, hard-working, self-sufficient music major, talented and unfortunately very closed off to any sort of interpersonal relationships. Garrett is a hockey player (Hello!! New favorite sport!), and a ""player"" in every other sense of the word. He is required to maintain a certain GPA to play on the team and for this, he needs a top-notch tutor for one of his classes. Enter Hannah. Excerpt that she absolutely refuses to have anything to do with Garrett.   There is so much more to Garrett than meets the eye. I loved how he slowly breaks down Hannah's resistance and she discovers, to her total surprise, that he is actually an incredibly decent and yes, very irresistible guy. The Deal is a wonderfully layered story, with the characters getting to know one another and slowly developing a bond. There are no contrived situations here or over-the-top plot developments. The story is pure gold and I absolutely loved every single word of it! (There was only one ""oops"" moment in this story which hopefully won't reappear in The Mistake - American college students don't use ""meters"" to describe measurements - they would use feet.)   There are also fabulous supporting characters here and I can't wait for their stories. Elle Kennedy has become a new favorite of mine and I look forward to reading more from her. Here are some of my favorite quotes from The Deal:   I have to say, this is the first time a girl's been worried about getting caught in my bedroom. Normally they strut out like they've just bagged Brad Pitt.   Hannah takes a breath. ""We studied. We watched TV. I went home late. That's what happened. Got it?""   I fight back laughter. ""As you wish.""   ""Did you really just Princess Bride me?""   ""Did you really just use Princess Bride as a verb?""   She glowers.   **************   I burst into the locker room and --   Penises!   Sweet Jesus.   Penises everywhere.   Horror slams into me as I register what I'm seeing. Oh God. I've stumbled onto a penis convention. Big penises and small penises and fat penises and penis-shaped penises. It doesn't matter which direction I move my head because everywhere I look I see penises.   (ARC provided with thanks for an honest review.)"

I am a huge fan of Pepper Winters and RUIN & RULE is another dark, action-packed and twisted tale from this incredibly talented writer.   If you're a fan of MC books, then you add this one to your must-read list!! It has it all, a strong, beautiful and spirited heroine, a tortured, complicated hero, tons of action and lots and lots of complicated plot twists and turns.   PURE IN THOUGHTS AND VENGEANCE. CORRUPT IN ALL THINGS THAT MATTER, and the symbolism of what he stood for. Biker.   I was on pins and needles from the first page of this book. I experienced the disorientation of our heroine, Sarah/Cleo, as she woke to the horrific reality of being held captive by a vicious MC gang. She feels a glimmer of recognition when she sees Arthur ""Kill"" Killian, but from where? When? I kept turning the pages to find the answers. Does Kill know her? Why is he so ruthless? There are so many to this story! Sarah/Cleo has lost her memory and her only clues to her past are tiny flashes of memories that come to her fleetingly. She feels a connection to Kill, but why?   ""I'm no one. And no one would've helped me. In my world--you survive or you die. You don't rely on others to make sure you do either one. It's the very first fucking lesson you learn."" The pain in his voice notched around my heart, squeezing.   I loved the small glimpses from Kill's POV. This book is a fantastic bundle of delicious mysteries all wrapped up in a sexy, dangerous biker package. Despite his hardened demeanor, Kill slowly allows himself to feel something for our heroine, all the while knowing his feelings could be the end of him.   For the first time in my godforsaken life, I felt... felt something instead of the cold hatred of vengeance. It gave me strength all while making me weak. I wanted more. Therefore, I had to stop. Before she destroyed me--just like all the rest.   Pepper Winters made me feel sorry for Kill, despite his outwardly vicious demeanor. This was a man who had suffered terribly and been horribly mistreated. But by whom? Many answers are revealed but I am definitely craving more.   ""I'd been spoon-fed lies all my life. I'd become a master at smelling untruths. And the woman currently residing in my home--the woman who'd healed me -- smelled terrifyingly toxic. A scent that made me want to run with one heartbeat and then fuck her with the next. She made me face things I was no longer strong enough to face. She made me look past her scam and crave.""   RUIN & RULE is told through a series of flashbacks interwoven with the present-day story. Pepper Winters is the mistress of a gripping and intense story and this one is no exception. Just when I though I knew what the outcome would be, she proved me wrong. RUIN & RULE is also a STUNNINGLY beautiful love story and succeeds as a romance on every level. There is a twist at the end and I cannot wait to get the next chapter in Kill and Cleo's story!!   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"

The story very fast-paced and engaging and the dialogue witty and filled with double entendres.   ""... If I change your tire, you let me ride with you.""   ""Ride with me?""   ""Ride me, yes.""   ""What did you just say?""   ""You're hearing things.""   I loved how Chance showed Aubrey how to loosen up and live in the moment. And I absolutely loved Aubrey's character, she's smart, and has amazing chemistry with Chance.   This story is very sexy but has lots of warmth and heart. I really enjoyed it! And I'll never look at Pixy Stix or bobbleheads the same way again. If you are looking for a great road trip story with a helluva hot Aussie, you'll love Cocky Bastard!"
202	adjudicated	good	Just, WOW. My first Kim Jones book and it absolutely BLEW ME AWAY! Sinners Creed excited me, stunned me, shocked me and yes, even made me cry. Which is not an easy feat. Even if you've read a lot of MC books, this book will surprise you and thrill you and I can't recommend it highly enough.   This is an unwavering, no-holds-barred look into club life, with all of the violence, sex and raw emotion you can imagine. Brotherhood comes before all else, and these men will sacrifice everything for their brothers. Dirk is no exception: he has become a notorious enforcer, a nomad, who travels wherever Club business takes him, always alone, always doing what needs to be done, no matter what the price.   Saylor comes into his life quite by accident, and gradually, slowly, they develop a deep and loving bond. Dirk has lived a sad, brutal life, and Saylor finally is something good in his life. Saylor is running from something, and Dirk agrees to take her on his travels across the country.   It is best if you go into this book without knowing too much detail about the plot. I knew nothing about this book when I started reading it. It turns out that Saylor loves to ride, and really, she is the only joyful part of Dirk's violent existence. This book took a very surprising turn which was perfect for these two characters. Some will love it, some will not, but take a chance on Sinner's Creed and go on the Dirk and Saylor's journey with them. This book was magical, gritty, raw and beautiful all at once.

I have loved Ms. Keeland's writing ever since I read her MMA Fighter series (Worth the Fight is a fantastic book and very underrated in my opinion). I am thrilled to see her show off her wonderful writing style with Bossman, a story that combines elements of humor, wit and the perfect amount of drama. Reese is the kind of heroine I love: smart, driven, a little sarcastic and very funny. She and Chase meet when she is stuck on a very bad date and he comes to her rescue. The whole situation is handled so perfectly! Chase is totally sexy and funny and charming, and surprise! It turns out that he is the founder of the company where she is starting a brand-new job. The company has a no-fraternization policy plus Reese has been burned by in the past when she slept with a co-worker. She has no intention of dating Chase, but he sure has fun pursuing her.   Chase leaned over to me as we continued walking down the hall and whispered, ""Stop worrying. Harassment policy only applies to employees, not the owner. Checked this morning.""   I absolutely loved the slow-burn romance between Chase and Reese! Even though they do not fall into bed immediately, there is plenty of steam and genuine emotion when they do get together. She is scared of getting into a relationship with Chase because he is her boss's boss but Chase really cares for her and is impossible to resist. But just when you think everything will be perfect for these two, his past overcomes him and it seems as though he will never recover from the terrible trauma of an earlier relationship.   ""Sometimes you don't know what you're missing until you find it""   I have to connect with the main characters to care at all about a story and I really connected with Reese and Chase. The book combined funny dialogue with some heavy emotion and it all just worked! I hope Vi Keeland writes more of these kinds of stories because they really show off her talent. I absolutely fell in love with Chase!! He's the total package and Reese's feelings for him just felt right.   ""I'm tired of looking back. It's been a long time since I've wanted to live in the moment.""   If you are new to Vi Keeland, give Bossman a try! It's got the perfect combination of great chemistry, emotion, a sexy and damaged hero and witty banter. I read this book in almost one sitting and loved the conclusion to Reese and Chase's story. Bossman is another great story from Vi Keeland, surprisingly angsty with the perfect amount of steam!!   ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review."

Laurelin Paige and Sierra Simone are the complete package. I highly recommend this one!!   Logan is a porn star but he really loves his job and makes no apologies for what he does. I loved the behind the scenes look into the porn industry and found it fascinating. Logan has had his heart broken by another adult film star but he has fantasized for years about Devi, who he met on set. Can two porn actors find true love together when their jobs involve having sex with other people?   Believe it or not, this book is actually full of romance along with the amazingly hot sex scenes and dirty talk. Logan is actually very sweet and Devi is filled with dreams of going back to school and maybe, just maybe, having a ""real"" relationship with Logan. They make a reality-tv type of film together which follows them as they pretend ""date"" but they both begin to fall for each other. The lines between their series and reality quickly become blurred. This book is filled with surprises and even has some very funny moments. I love both of these authors and their first book together is hot, sweet and a total guilty pleasure.

You might think you've heard that before, but honestly, you have never read a story like PUSH before. I won't go into detail about the plot because this book is best read without knowing too much about the storyline. Going in blind to this book is so much more thrilling!   Emma is moving on from her past and horrible stepfather and two brothers who were manipulated by him. She's had a rough life. She is starting over on her own, which is very freeing for her. She meets David they day she moves into her in apartment. He is the handyman for the building and was ""sent"" by the owner to fix her kitchen, which is a mess. She opens her door hesitantly, unsure of whether he's telling the truth or whether he is just a psycho. My anxiety attack began when she opened the door. You will need tranquilizers for this story!! It does end with a cliffhanger and I told myself, ""No! It can't end like this!"" But PUSH is so well-written that it is like a breath of fresh air. Get ready for a love-hate relationship with one of the characters. This is an excellent summer read! PUSH should be receiving more attention and acclaim because it's that good! Don't miss this one."

310	adjudicated	good	"4.5 Stars!!   Swoon!!! Ladies and gentleman, meet Gray Grayson and prepare to fall in LOVE!!   THE FRIEND ZONE is a super-funny, very steamy, and very romantic sports romance that I absolutely adored. It can be read as a standalone although two characters from The Hook-Up make appearances here. If you are looking for a fast-paced, clever story, then THE FRIEND ZONE is for you.   I think one of my favorite quotes of the year so far has to be from this book:   ""I'm trying to commiserate, you noodle. Because the itching was torture when it grew back. And do not get me started on the pain of waxing. I was certain that evil woman had ripped my lady lips off.""   ""Lady lips? Oh Christ."" His gleeful laughter echoes through the stadium.   ""This is so not funny,"" I protest, my hands on my hips as his abs clench--which, unf--and he cracks up. ""It was the worst pain of my life. And I've broken my arm in two places.""   Lady lips! I love it! But the story is great and the supporting characters all vital to the story and just as interesting as Gray and Ivy. Ivy has vowed never to do casual hook-ups, especially with an athlete. Her sports-agent father's lifestyle turned her off to that. And Gray isn't interested in a monogamous relationship, until of course, he meets Ivy.   This book is extremely clever and the author creates a real and meaningful friendship between Ivy and Gray. Their relationship is believable, sweet and honest, and so their eventual sexy times did not feel rushed at all, but instead felt like a perfectly natural progression of their growing passion.   And speaking of sex, did I mention that Gray is irresistible? Yep, perfect boyfriend material. The nighttime stadium scene? I died a little. He's an intelligent and incredibly gifted athlete with a bright future ahead if only he can withstand his sorry excuse for a family.   ""To me it's a cathedral. I sit here and I feel calm, centered. And yet it's like all the energy of games past remains, coursing through my veins, and I can't wait for the next game.""   These two are meant for each other, it's just that they don't quite realize it at the beginning:   ""His forearm tenses, and I find him staring at me with wide eyes. Pain resides there, and a sort of longing too. I recognize it in myself -- that need to have someone understand how empty life can feel, as if you're the only one in your universe.   Gray holds my gaze for another second then clears his throat. ""Shit, Mac, you're going to have me bawling like a baby soon."" He gives me a lopsided smile.""   Ivy and Gray care deeply for each other; they both had sad and lonely lives when they were younger, some of which has spilled over into their young adult lives and which has brought them closer together. But never fear, the author watches over your heart and doesn't let anything too painful happen to it.   Gray falls for ivy, despite his surprise at the depth of his feelings for her. It was actually quite beautiful to watch his feelings unfold   ""And that strange dichotomy is my Ivy. Insane planner mixed with a free spirit who goes with the flow. A surge of affection hits me, and I sink further into the pillows.""   Lest I forget to rave about the sexy times, they are HAWT!! Take one 6'6'' football player who weighs well over 200 pounds, with a drop-dead body and a very sensitive and loving soul and you have the recipe for PERFECT sex! And they both like to act out fantasies. THUD.   There are some very serious and sensitive moments in The Friend Zone, but they are handled with sensitivity and grace by the author. And the Epilogue was perfect! Not completely unexpected but tender and loving nonetheless."

This is not a ""typical"" Mia Sheridan story but it is magical, enchanting and irresistible nonetheless. Two very strong, sexy and damaged lead characters make this a very memorable story.   The story begins in a very gripping way: Kira is desperate, almost homeless, and immediately propositions Grayson Hawthorn with an almost-insane scheme: she must marry in order to gain access to an inheritance from her grandmother. Grayson, too, his desperate: he is about to lose his precious winery, and has reached a dead end due to his prison record.   Grayson is sexy, handsome, yet aloof and emotionally closed off. He has been hurt by those he trusted and loved. Kira is also emotionally damaged, but yet she still remains warm and engaging and filled with hope. She is young and impulsive but truly believes marrying Grayson is her only hope.   I fell in love with Grayson. He is cruel to most people but when you learn about his past, well, your heart will break for him. And Kira was betrayed by those she trusted most, which could have left her cruel and emotionally cut-off but she still retains the capacity to love.   ""In Vino Veritas. In wine there is truth. In love there is truth.""   Grayson's Vow is set in and around Napa, California, one of my most favorite places in the world!! I absolutely loved the scenery and the setting. There is also an engaging cast of supporting characters in this book which I loved. There is an air of magic to this book, which adds a bit of whimsy and lightens the emotional heaviness of the plot. There is PLENTY of steam and Grayson is just YUMMY. Who doesn't love a bad boy with a heart of gold?   This book is very different from Ms. Sheridan's other books, and gets into some overly-dramatic scenes near the end of the story. I still found this to be a beautiful story about the power of love and acceptance and honesty. And the EPILOGUE...OMG!! A 10+ which had be sobbing happy tears for Grayson and Kira.

I had high hopes for 'Fury' and Cat Porter exceeded every single one of my expectations and then some!! A gritty, incredibly sensual and emotional thrill ride. Put this one on your must-read list!   ""Why did we have to sacrifice love for love?""   This is a story that spans decades and offers up the very best in the MC romance genre. There are many biker books out there but Cat Porter is one of the most talented writers in this genre. From the minute we first meet Lenore, she is tortured, anguished an abused. Finger is a young prospect being held prisoner and their bonds are forged in fire.   Finger never forgets Lenore. She is branded onto his soul. There's is a love story that literally spans many years but cannot be denied. Once again, Ms. Porter writes characters that are devastatingly honest and real and their emotions are raw and brutal. The MC life is not an easy one. Many scenes in this book are raw and graphic. But through it all, Finger and Lenore rise above their savage pasts.   ""Hell and heaven. Beautiful and horrible. We found each other first in the dark and then in the light and in all the shadows in between. No matter how I tried convincing myself that I should forget, the scars never allowed it.""   'Fury' is a total roller-coaster ride of emotions. It takes a lot for me to cry but this book brought me to my knees! Never in a million years did I expect the twist to this book. AND, as if there wasn't enough to love about this story, I fell in love with Tania! HELLO.   My favorite books involve couples who are older and have lived and experienced life. 'Fury' delivers that and then some. Finger and Lenore have suffered and triumphed through so much, I was hoping against hope that they would find their happy ending. Loyalty, brotherhood, love, devotion, revenge and friendship...'Fury' has it all. Don't miss this one!!   ""She is at the crux. She is the flame. My fever, my fury. Let it roar."""
54	adjudicated	poor	Great book. A sci-fi classic. The fact that Gibson wrote this in 1984 is very impressive, as he makes many predictions that seem like they are coming true (was that a prediction?).
390	adjudicated	average	Vanquish was not at all what I expected and is a painfully beautiful story of the redemptive power of love and devotion. Yes, I LOVE Van, and for those of you who have read Deliver, you know that he is twisted, really f*ed up and obsessively, possessively in love with Liv. He seemed BAD through and through but I knew better! I couldn't wait to read his story because I knew there was much more to him.   Vanquish totally blew me away. It is really a story of two painfully lonely people who really only want to connect with another human being on the most basic of levels. But this being a Pam Godwin story, well, you get two very effed up people, tons of mind-blowing sex, and lots of danger thrown into the mix.   Pam Godwin's writing is pure perfection. There is no insta-connection, the emotions are real and the sexual chemistry is explosive. This book has it all. And Amber broke my heart. I am a huge Pam Godwin fan and I will devour every book she writes. Vanquish is raw, gritty, beautiful, suspenseful, sexy and painful. What more could you possibly ask for?

Therapy is an absolutely beautifully written book that explores very sensitive topics of depression, bullying, self-harming and addiction in an unflinching way, but without ever dragging the reader down or making the situations too unbearable. Jessica has a tormented life, but I was cheering for her and I loved the way the author really got inside this young girl's mind. Jace comes to her rescue, but he is certainly no cookie-cutter hero and battles demons of his own throughout the book.   The time span of this book is wide and it is a rich story filled with unforgettable characters. There are some major ""oh wow"" moments so I'll keep this review spoiler-free. Jessica is tormented relentlessly by bullies in high school. She battles depression and engages in self-harming (very graphically depicted) and makes some other very poor choices that will come back to haunt her later. Jace is the quintessential popular high school jock who befriends Jess and their friendship grows into a deep and lasting love.   But nothing is ever easy for Jess, so this is not a hearts-and-flowers love story between her and Jace. The author writes a wonderfully detailed story and it should be read without knowing the plot spoilers! This is a must-read book for its sensitivity, writing and creativity. I loved the story and can't wait to read more from Ms. Perez.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
483	adjudicated	average	The gorgeous cover of Undertow always intrigued me and I am happy to say that the writing fully matches the cover. This is a beautifully written story that has family drama, a great plot and a twist on the usual romance story. I loved the characters of Aesa (great name) and Decker. I also loved Aesa's father, the ship captain who seems to have everyone's respect excerpt for his daughter's.   Secrets are revealed, lots of action and romance ensue, and I couldn't put this book down, I read it in one sitting. I really cared about Aesa and Decker and felt emotionally connected to them. Treat yourself and read Undertow, you will not be disappointed. There is no cliffhanger here and this book is a standalone, but I would really love to read more about these characters! Amber Lynn Natusch is a wonderful writer and I can't wait to read more from her.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)

420	adjudicated	average	"4.5 SMOKING HOT stars!!   Um...wow...what did I just read? If It Drives is hands-down my favorite book in the Market Garden series. This story focuses on ""Red Tie guy"", the wealthy banker James Harcourt.   His driver Cal has a crush on James, and wants to figure out why James keeps going back to Market Garden when Cal is available and literally right in front of his face. One night they cross over the employer/employee line, and what a night it is! But something seems lacking, and Cal feels that he can't quite give James what he really needs. Cal then embarks on a journey to explore his own Dom side and he and James have some smoking hot scenes together. But will James realize that Cal wants more than meaningless, one-night stands?   If It Drives turned into a quite tender and lovely romance between Cal and James in between all the scorching hot scenes. I absolutely loved the development of their Dominant/submissive relationship and did I mention the sex scenes BURN UP up the page? I also loved the emotional connection between the characters, and Cal's inner dialogue. He came across as surprisingly thoughtful and sweet, an interesting mix with his Dom tendencies.   This is a fantastic addition to the Market Garden series and I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a gutsy, sexy and surprisingly emotional love story."
81	adjudicated	average	A really interesting novel that takes place in the future in a world where some people live in the metaverse (aka digital universe/internet) more than the real world. I don't remember it so well now but I do remember there being some really interesting tie-ins to ancient sumarian computers.   That plus any book with a protagonist named Hiro Protagonist who wields badass japanese swords is just badass.   Note: the MetaVerse is current being built now here: http://secondlife.com
206	adjudicated	good	"Well that was very unexpected and different! I am a huge fan of L.H. Cosway and this is my first book by Penny Reid. This is part of the Rugby series but can absolutely be read as a standalone. This book is NOT your typical sports romance! It features a gorgeous ruby star who surprisingly, needs to learn some skills in the bedroom! This is a very funny and VERY sexy take on a familiar theme and I enjoyed every word of this story.   Lucy is the sister of a star rugby player. She is quirky, different and has a very unusual way of dealing with anxiety - she has a compulsion to shoplift. Not so easy to hide when the media is lurking everywhere. At first she dislikes Sean, her brother's teammate, but beneath his bad-boy reputation is a kind, generous and loving soul.   ""Beauty comes in many forms, and the strong, powerful kind is the most admirable. It's easy to be weak; you simply do nothing, but strength takes courage and effort.""   Sean has his own issues to deal with. He doesn't seem interested in proving his teammates wrong about his cocky reputation and his family is not exactly warm and fuzzy. Lucy is afraid of alienating her brother if he finds out that she and Sean are seeing each other, so they agree to keep their romance a secret at first. Lucy is going to teach Sean how to be a better lover - I LOVED how they did NOT start off with spectacular sex!! But Sean is so sweet and is a very, very good student. He begins to develop real feelings for Lucy and she begins to fall for Sean, too.   ""I don't want to close my eyes when I could be looking at you""   The Player and the Pixie is a sweet, funny and totally fresh story. I absolutely adored Lucy and Sean and the very unique storyline. These two are very memorable characters and I highly recommend this book even if you are not usually a fan of sports romance!   (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)"
35	adjudicated	average	** spoiler alert **   I equally loved book 2, and am definitely hooked. I did feel it took a little while for them to get to sea, but I guess we can't bring in a love interest if we aren't on the land!   My favorite thing by far was the Lively, and the descriptions of how fast she is and how much care the crew took keeping her a crack ship. Pride in what you do can be a great motivator. I also loved how Jack made them work the guns against all the batteries for practice.
264	adjudicated	average	4.5 Stars   Classic enemies-to-lovers romance, one that I couldn't put down once I started reading! Hollywood-superstar-meets-ordinary-girl is one of my favorite themes, and Alessandra Torre serves it up with plenty of sexiness, warmth and down-home Southern style. This is a book that could have gotten bogged down in cliches but in the hands of Alessandra Torre, it is a smart, funny, and very insightful peek into the donwside of Hollywood superstardom. I absolutely loved the realistic yet loving portrait of small-town Southern life as painted by Ms. Torre. Although the author is quick to state that this is a contemporary romance and is not like her other books, there is PLENTY of steam and sexy times in this book!! Cole is just irresistibile. And the banter between the hero and heroine is priceless. And no one writes a smart and sassy heroine quite like Alessandra Torre. The only quarrel I had with this story is the portrayal of the legal proceedings involving Brad DeLuca. Meh. Other than that, I loved Hollywood Dirt and found myself with a book hangover after leaving the fictional town of Quincy GA.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
428	adjudicated	excellent	"5+++ stars! Rex took my breath away. A must-read!   This incredible book begins with this beautiful dedication:   ""To every child who waited for a savior that never came.""   You don't need to be a fan of fighter books to absolutely cherish this heartbreaking and ultimately incredibly uplifting story of Rex and Georgia. Fighting for Flight is one of my top reads so far of 2014 and stayed with me long after I finished.   This book paints a vividly detailed picture of the heartbreaking pasts of Rex and Georgia. He was in foster care with her, but he had a nightmarish childhood that haunts him in expected ways as an adult. He is troubled both sexually and emotionally and can never quite put his finger on what is at the root of his problems. He does know that he is attracted to the somewhat elusive new friend.   Rex is both a singer in a band and a fighter. While he can't recall his childhood, she holds the key to his past, and while she is desperately trying to correct her past mistakes, and alleviate some of the crushing guilt she has carried with her for her entire life, she doesn't always go about it in the best way. Assumptions are made, hearts are broken, beautiful words are spoken...and during this incredible book, I absolutely fell in love with Rex.   ""The pain. It's the only thing that reminds me I'm alive. When most of the time I wish I were dead.""   Georgia understands Rex on a very deep and intimate level and their scenes together are breathtaking! I was blown away by the incredible intimacy and deep emotional connection Ms. Salsbury created between the two characters, a connection that is often missing for me in most books.   The author doesn't try to gloss over Rex's horrific childhood. His present-day obsessive-compulsive disorder is honestly dealt with and very detailed. I loved the fact that Rex was also a musician and his lyrics are testament to the author's incredible writing talent and creativity:   Vivid dreams, different faces   Waves of hate and lust in traces   Festering sickness, my insides rot   There's no pill for what I've got.   Fighting to Forget is a must-read. It has steam, unforgettable characters, a heartbreaking storyline, intensity, creativity and emotion. Do not miss this one!! Jamie Salsbury has become my new 1-click author and I can't wait for more books in this series.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
367	adjudicated	average	Many readers loved this book but it just wasn't for me. I am a fan of dark romance, dark erotica, romantic thrillers, the whole nine yards so the darker elements were fine for me but I just didn't connect with the main characters. I definitely suggest giving this book a try because the story has a lot of promise but there were just too many character and plot inconsistencies for me to become invested in the story. I will read the author's other books because they sound very interesting and readers whose opinion I trust have really loved her writing.
92	adjudicated	average	"4 - 4.5 Stars!!   ""If I ever lay eyes on you again... I can't promise I'll do what's best and walk away next time...""   Fancy a fast-paced, well-written sexy romance? 'The Forbidden' is all that and more!! This is not so much a taboo romance as it is the story of two people who simply meet at the wrong time. Annie is an up-and-coming, career-driven architect who has no time for relationships. She has just never felt that ""spark"" with any man. Jack and Annie meet one night in a bar when she is out for a fun night with friends. They have an immediate connection that only Jodi-Ellen Malpas can make seem SO real.   Jack's marriage was over long before he met Annie. While some might see this as a bright line that should never be crossed, Jack instead seemed to me to be sweet, vulnerable and craving an intimate connection. Annie for one cannot believe she has found herself in this situation but Jack is everything she never knew she wanted.   ""I would never have put myself in this situation for anything less than powerful love. The kind that keeps you going. The kind that gives you breath and life. Jack's my life. He's my pulse. He's everything.""   This story would be empty and unconvincing in the hands of a less talented writer. But JEM really creates nuanced characters with hard choices to make. Nothing is black and white here. While the story got a little too over-dramatic for me near the end, I nonetheless loved this book and highly recommend it!   ""I'm in hell and I'm in heaven. I'm flying and I'm drowning.""   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"

474	adjudicated	average	"This book drew me in right from the first few pages. Lorrie has been (understandably) struggling with the tragic deaths of both parents. She has returned to college after taking time off and feels overwhelmed by her life. She is almost literally thrown right into the arms of the incredibly hot Hunter ""The Hammer"" Jensen, a fellow college student who also happens to be a sexy MMA fighter. Lorrie finally feels a little emotion, but refuses to let herself become romantically involved with Hunter.   I really loved Hunter. He is sexy, incredibly sweet to Lorrie, and doesn't give up when Lorrie tries to keep him at arm's length. There's a slow build up to their relationship, but when they get together, BAM! The floodgates really open up, so to speak! The author really knows how to write incredibly steamy sex scenes, and Hunter and Lorrie are totally HOT together.   There were parts of this story that I became frustrated with Lorrie. I mean, this gorgeous and really caring guy wanted to be more than friends but she kept pushing him away. It then becomes clear that Hunter also has a wounded soul and is maybe hiding a secret or two of his own.   I really enjoyed this book. What started off as a typical college story turned into something more for me. I liked the creative plot and the emotion between Lorrie and Hunter. This book ends on a very suprising note and I can't wait to read more of Lorrie and Hunter's story!   (Copy provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
53	adjudicated	average	"I really enjoyed this book. The concept of a man who had grown up on Mars and never seen another human until he was in his twenties is such a fun idea - and a rich canvas. Watching Mike try to grok humans gave a Heinlein great opportunities to point out some of our faults - and our advantages.   I think my favorite part of this book is the word 'grok'. I would bet that there are deep discussions over the true meaning of this word - but I will contend that its closest meaning in English is 'to be enlightened about something'. If you grok God you have reached enlightenment. If you grok music you truly understand in the way that Mozart understood it. If you grok another person you love them. If you grok programming then you truly love and are really good at programming - that, and you're also a probably a pretty big nerd for using a word like 'grok' :) I used it in front of my girlfriend and she still hasn't forgiven me, since I had to explain that it was ""a Martian word""!   One thing that I grokked (yes I'm going to keep using it dammit) after finishing this book is that it is kind of a 60's manifesto for free love. I wasn't alive in the 60's, but given everything I know about the 60's from movies, books, etc it seemed that my grokking was right."
346	adjudicated	good	"PURE PERFECTION!!   I could read only Kristen Ashley books and be very happy. RIDE STEADY is another slam-dunk winner from the Queen of Alphas, with a story that ripped my heart out and characters that I won't soon forget. Joker might be one Ms. Ashley's most unforgettable Alphas ever, a man who rose from a painful and loveless childhood to become a patched-in Brother of the Chaos MC. Chaos became his family, and the MC recognized the fire burning in Joker that would serve the club well.   ""He was at the shop window, empty pockets, face pressed to the glass, starin' at what he wanted but couldn't have. I'll wager, to survive, he's banked that fire. We gotta help him direct it and make sure if it flares bright, it doesn't burn him out.""   Carissa Teodoro's life becomes entwined with Joker's, as the two former high school classmates meet again years later. Let me just say that this book is so incredibly gripping and heartbreaking and sexy, that I am tempted to re-read it to experience these feelings all over again! She was once the golden girl who had it all, and he was the boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Their story spans years and that is what I love about Ms. Ashley's writing: there is no Insta-love here, instead, our hero and heroine have a shared history that adds a depth and richness to this book.   ""Yeah, Carrie,"" he answered. ""It's you. It's always been you. It'll always be you. Fuckin' always.""   Joker is a sexy, bad-ass Alpha biker that has zero interest in relationships, or in real friendships for that matter, since he has a hard time opening up to anyone about his feelings or his past. That is what makes his relationship with Carrie so poignant: this is a man who is so closed off and afraid of emotional bonds that he has been alone (and lonely) most of his life.   Carrie draws his out just by being herself. She is going through a messy and painful divorce, has a baby, is struggling to make ends meet and has a ton of emotional baggage. She is not perfect but she is open to love and gives her heart unconditionally to Joker.   ""Rule,"" he stated instantaneously.   His strange word made me blink at the lockers. ""Sorry?""   ""Rule. You can't be like that on the phone. You can only be like that when I can kiss you.""   I lifted a hand and pressed it to the cold steel of my locker, leaning into it because my knees suddenly wouldn't support me.   ""You hear me?"" he asked. ""Yes, Joker.""   OH. EM. GEE!! *SWOON* I can't say enough about Ride Steady. Plus some of my favorite bad-ass Alphas from Ms. Ashley's other books make appearances here! Dead. There is also a sneak peek at the next Chaos book at the end of Ride Steady and it sounds amazing. Joker and Carissa's story is beautiful, thrilling and passionate. Ride Steady is a must-read!   Favorite quotes:   ""Butterfly, you're cute all the time, cuter some times more than others, and it's fucked up because right now you're bein' a pain in the ass and this is one of those times that you're cuter. But you gotta get this so you can get over it. My old man doesn't exist for me. I left him and that life behind, and I don't want it back in any way it can come back.""

Totally unexpected story by the incredible Leylah Attar! Dark and emotional but ultimately passionate and hopeful. A must-read. I couldn't put it down and read it almost in one sitting.   After I read 53 LETTERS FOR MY LOVER, I fell in love with Leylah Attar's writing. It is rich, mature, and lush. I couldn't wait until her newest book and was completely intrigued by the synopsis for THE PAPER SWAN. Not much of the plot is given away, for good reason. There is not much I can add to the stellar reviews for this book, other than to say that Ms. Attar has a unique voice and an incredible gift with words. Nothing prepared me for the emotions that I felt while reading The Paper Swan. The characters, the plot, the epilogue - all perfect, unique and gloriously realized.   I like a good dark read as much as I love a sexy contemporary romance and this book actually blends these two genres together. My attention has been wandering as of late and I have struggled to finish a lot of the books I have been reading. However, I read The Paper Swan from cover to cover (do Kindles even have ""covers""?) and basically ignored real life until I finished this magnificent story. I don't know how to describe this story other than to say everyone has some redeeming quality, no matter how evil they act, and those whom you think are above criticism might have skeletons in their closet and may not be what they seem.   The story is filled with tons of suprising twists, along with a stunning story of survival, redemption and forgiveness Nothing can prepare you for this story or for the depth of emotion you will feel. The dialogue is witty and intelligent and the heroine is smart and loving and very capable.   Without giving too much away, this is a story about love, passion, family, hate, revenge and survival. And devotion.   ""We are stars with flaws that still sparkle and shine. We always strive, always want, always have more questions than answers, but there are moments like these, full of magic and contentment, when souls get a glimpse of the divine and quite simply, lose their breath.""   The Paper Swan is one of the most unique books I've ever read. Based on the synopsis, I went into thinking I was getting one thing, but was surprised with what this book was actually about. There is much more I want to say about this book, but it's hard to without giving anything away. This is just one of those books that it's better to go into blind. The fact that you don't know what to expect makes The Paper Swan even better.   I will say that The Paper Swan is an incredibly written book with tons of plot twists and smart characters, The story spans a good amount of time and that adds a richness to the relationship between the two main protagonists.   This book is captivating, intense, sexy and funny all in one book. I am still thinking about The Paper Swan weeks after I finished. Simply put, The Paper Swan was absolutely amazing. I can't recommend it highly enough. 5 fantastic stars!!!   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
242	adjudicated	average	"4 - 4.5 Stars   I loved this book!! I am obsessed with Zaal Kostava. This is a really dark but VERY sexy and enjoyable story. Reap is filled with passion, emotion and heat. It is most definitely my favorite Tillie Cole book. The horribly scarred and damaged Zaal absolutely broke my heart. But his beauty and soul shine through when he finds kindness and yes, even love, after many tortuous twists and turns. Although this should read after Raze, it is a stunning story and I highly recommend both books. Talia is a fantastic heroine, strong, beautiful and compassionate. Loving Zaal might come with dire consequences, but she cannot be without him.   ""You are my Zaal, the man whose soul has stolen mine.""

316	adjudicated	average	"ARC provided by the author for an honest review.)   4 - 4.5 Stars!!   I absolutely loved Fighting Silence! Till Page is a memorable character that I won't soon forget! Struggling against dirt-poor poverty, absentee parents and an inevitable loss of his hearing, this book pulled at my heartstrings and thrilled me from beginning to end.   Till is a fighter, taking care of his younger brothers to keep them out of the social services system. His only bright spot in an otherwise dismal existence is his neighbor Eliza Reynolds, who he spends every minute with after school, but who he completely ignores during the day.   She is just a gorgeous person, inside and out, and Till is frightened of ruining their relationship with sex, so... they spend part of the book battling their attraction to each other.   ""Eliza was a crier. She pretended that it was only when she was mad. That was bullshit though. She cried every time the wind blew north. Happy, sad, angry--it didn't matter. I loved it when she happy cried. I laughed when she angry cried. I was gutted when she sad cried. I'd held her through all of them. But her reaction that night was extraordinary. I guessed my present was pretty extraordinary too though.""   Eliza is sensitive but strong. I loved that about her character! This is not a typical fighter story, it is fresh and new and make no mistake, Till and ""Doodle"" BURN up the pages when they get together. This story is told in alternating POV's and flashes forward in time but Aly Martinez does an amazing job with the alternating voices.   This is a story of true devotion, fighting for happiness and fighting for the right to love and be loved. Sounds sappy, but this book is so much more! I loved it!   ""Till and I both knew we had a strange relationship. It was more than a friendship, but there wasn't romance or sex. There was definitely love though. Immeasurable amounts of it. I knew that Till had this grand fantasy about me. But what he didn't realized was all that he gave me in return. He was the only thing I'd ever had that I honestly thought I couldn't live without. Till Page was my soulmate on every level."""

And this one started off very strong for me! I loved the premise of the story: ugly-duckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pent-up frustration. Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landon's family. She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon.   However, the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other.   Penelope Ward is the queen of second-chance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters. I didn't quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try. The story has some very valuable messages about self-esteem and forgiveness. And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!! I would have liked a little more build-up to the full-blown relationship between Landon and Rana. BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms. Ward's main characters, he is simply unforgettable!!   His hands may have been calloused; his arms may have been inked; he may have looked dangerous, but Landon was as gentle as he was protective.   'Drunk Dial' is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA. While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book, I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the second-chance, friends to lovers storyline. This is a sexy, passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion. Enjoy Landon Roderick! I know I did.   Our story was a lot like a Rubik's Cube - colourful and complicated. It took years to work it out, but then suddenly like magic, on a random Sunday, everything all came together.   (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)"

A story about a 42-year-old heroine who has sacrificed her whole life to the One-Eyed Jacks MC, LOCK & KEY is hot, sexy, thrilling, perfectly written and filled with characters that I won't soon forget.   Grace and Lock meet right at the beginning of the story and sparks fly. They are both damaged and not looking to connect with another human being on any kind of meaningful level. They spend an incredibly HOT night together ((hello, ice cube scene!!), thinking they'll never see each other again, but boy, are they dead wrong.   I fell in love with Lock, he is one bad-ass biker but he knows a good thing is right in front of him. The problem is, will he realize what a treasure Grace is before she slips away?   ""I had my dream on my hands and in my mouth, and I never fucking realized.""   This story is perfectly told in both a combination of flashbacks and alternating POVs. The book unfolds like a flower petal, layer by layer peeled away until the reader is left incredibly satisfied at the end. This is a long and meaty book, filled with plenty of drama and scorching hot sex scenes, but I literally could not put it down until the very end. Ms. Porter has created a world of memorable characters, Alpha bikers, strong and feisty women and a solid story that will stay with me for a long time to come.   I highlighted half the book but instead I am ""borrowing"" the author's teasers. This is an original and very creative story so I don't want to give any of the plot away. Add Lock & Key to your TBR list immediately! This is a must-read book for all fans of strong writing, characters with backbone and beautiful stories about the importance of family and second-chance love. Ms. Porter deserves a place among Joanna Wylde, Madeline Sheehan and dare I say Ms. Kristen Ashley with her absolutely incredible debut MC romance book. Go meet Grace and Lock.

274	adjudicated	average	Sweet and unexpectedly romantic and SEXY!! I love a story with a single mom and The Offer has that plus much more. I loved all the characters in this book, plus Steph and Lident make appearances as well. However, you do not need to have read The Pact to enjoy this story. Nicola is living on the edge, trying to make a home for her daughter Ava but struggling to make ends meet since Ava's dad is absent. Along comes Bram, who seems to be quite the sexy player, confident and bold.   But Bram isn't what he seems, there's more than meets the eye here, and after some amazing chemsitry and hot sex, Nicole finds herself falling for Bram. There is no Insta-love here, Nicola and Bram's banter is great and she does not instantly fall for his moves.   I loved Ava, and Ms. Halle writes the scenes with her with great compassion and understanding. Ava is adorable. But sexy-talking Bram is the star here, and I really liked how he had many different sides to his personality. This is a classic contemporary romance, with modern characters, genuine dialogue and very realistic situations.   There is a wonderful Epilogue plus a suprising twist which was all very satisfying. The Offer is a great summer read, full of sexy times, great banter and very sympathetic characters.   (ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
167	adjudicated	good	Smoking hot conclusion to The Player!! Loved it. Filled with warmth, heat and plenty of angst. K. Bromberg is my go-to author for mature, emotional romances about real people dealing with real issues and facing them head-on. And 'The Catch' delivered on all counts.   I loved the in-depth look into the sport of baseball (but you do NOT need to be a fan of sports romances to love this story!) and the glimpse into the emotional highs and lows experienced by star athletes AND by their families and loved ones! The end of 'The Player' was a whopper of a cliffhanger (I won't spoil it here!) and then BOOM! 'The Catch' does a 180 degree turn!   I appreciated Easton's POV here and as always, Ms. Bromberg created a male character with many dimensions. Easton is flawed, but he really puts himself out there and his HONESTY is what I loved most about him. Easton and Scout both grew as characters and their love, devotion to family and feelings for each other were absolutely spot-on.
329	adjudicated	average	"5 DARK AND SEXY STARS!!!   Pepper Winters has created yet another richly woven story in Final Debt, along with even more backstory and fantastic insight into the series' characters. It is difficult for me to adequately describe my feelings about this book and the characters, first because I've read early copies of almost every one of them and second because Jethro and Nila are two of my favorite main characters. It is hard to say the word ""hero"" in the same sentence as Jethro because of the dark nature of this series, but trust me, he truly becomes the man he is meant to be in Final Debt. And the Epilogue? Pure gold.   I was completely and utterly satisfied with the way the author concluded this series. My emotions were all over the place while reading this last book and the Epilogue. At times I was fearful that the worst would happen, and at other times I was hoping against hope that Nila and Jethro would overcome all of the dark forces that conspired against them. To say this book is an emotional roller coaster is an understatement. The historical-romance-themed tone of this series again shines through in this book and I am THRILLED at the announcement of a related book about William Hawk! The only thing that would make me happier is if these books were made into a movie or television series.   Expect LOTS of surprises in this incredibly satisfying conclusion to the Indebted Series. My heart is breaking a little at saying goodbye to Jethro and Nila."
493	adjudicated	average	Her is a sweet, romantic story with just the right amount of steam. I love alternate POV's and the author does a great job in giving us Will's version of his and Sarah's story. The male POV and the sexy scenes keep this story from being too sweet or sentimental. Carey Heywood is a very talented writer and really brings these characters to life. Will is totally swoon-worthy and is fantastic book boyfriend material! He is sooo romantic! Overall a lovely, romantic story with some hot scenes and just the right touch of emotion!
135	adjudicated	average	"5 STARS!!   An intelligent, twisty psychological thriller that kept me up all night! I'll try not to reveal too much about the plot because it is a shocker! Zoe is a stunning Manhattan socialite, living in a world of charity dinners, beautiful apartments and gorgeous vacation homes. She has everything she could want at her fingertips: a designer wardrobe, a private cook and romantic getaways with her perfect husband, Henry.   ""I stop protesting his indulgence, when he buys me clothing and shoes and jewelry. I stop looking for the catch. There doesn't seem to be one. So what do you do?""   But right from the beginning, there are cracks in Zoe's perfect life, and we don't know whether it is from her damaged past or from someone or something in her current life. She is growing bored as Henry's wife, and longs for her younger self, when she had a job, friends and freedom to do whatever she wanted. She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble.   ""I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person.""   Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really ""knew"" him at all.   ""Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day.""   But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life. I don't want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns. I absolutely loved Zoe's slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose. The author kept me guessing for the whole book!   'The Vanishing Year' has been called a ""domestic thriller"". This is a perfect description. It is an edgy, sexy, exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end. The little clues sprinkled here and there, the red herrings, the gorgeous Henry all added up to the perfect thriller for me! Don't miss this one. I can't wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti.   Favorite quote:   ""It wasn't that long ago that I found this sort of convenient arrangement of our lives to be charming, like a party card trick. A sleight of hand here, a simple misdirection there, and Voila, here's your dinner. Now, it crawls under my skin and festers there, like a chigger, and the whole thing makes me itch.""

307	adjudicated	excellent	"4.5 STARS   What an amazing story!! Lust, sex, chemistry and tons of action fill Mel and Painter's story. Never a dull moment here and the sex is OFF. THE. CHARTS. There's lots of MC goodness, because there is a fantastic epilogue PLUS other treats in store for readers of Reaper's Fall!!   I ADORE Joanna Wylde's writing. She writes MC romance with a certain excitement but also realism that is absolutely addictive. Every one of her men is rough, sexy and real. Reaper's Fall is Painter and Melanie's story and uses one of my favorite tropes, the lovers-to-enemies theme. Their early contact is really limited to just letters while Painter is in prison. The build-up is slow and delicious and when they break apart, as you know that they will, it is emotional and heartbreaking and fiery. I literally devour every book by Joanna Wylde and Reaper's Fall was no different. Although the characters from previous books appear here, this book can abaolutely be read as a standalone but I LOVED seeing all of my ""old friends"".   These books are rouch, they are messy, there is not always hearts and flowers. Melanie doesn't always make the right decisions but what I love about Ms W writing is that her characters are always trying to better themselves, and Melanie is no different. And Painter makes no apologies for who he is, and when he and Melanie get together, it is pure heat and emotion.   Melanie is very stubborn and rebels against the MC. The actions of the club members are not sugar-coated here but that makes Melanie and Painter's journey that much more bittersweet. And did I mention there's plenty of humor here to balance out the raw passion and emotion and incredibly steamy sex??   ""If I had to fall in love with an asshole, at least he was a hot asshole.""   I will read every single book that Joanna Wylde writes. Every story from Ms. Wylde delivers the goods. And, as an added bonus here, there is a FANTASTIC Epilogue!! I can't wait for the next book from this fabulous author.   Favorite Quote:   ""I still wanted better for her. Someone nice, who'd work a steady job, maybe take her to Hawaii every other year. Wash her car on Saturday mornings. Unfortunately, every time I tried to picture the guy, he was dead at my feet.""   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"
481	adjudicated	average	Samanthe Beck has written a hot, sexy, smutty and fabulous military book! Michael is strong, loving, sexy as hell, and meets Chloe under very funny circumstances, Chloe is his free-spirited neighbor who has been very unlucky at love and can't believe this gorgeous Marine would be attracted to her. Their sex scenes are totally hot and the story overall is very well-written and believable. I loved the Epilogue! I am a new fan of Brazen and Samanthe Beck and highly recommend Falling for the Marine, especially when you want a fairly quick, smutty book with a gorgeous and sweet Alpha. Happy reading!

320	adjudicated	excellent	"Life happened, and then happened some more, and kept happening until you were so caught up in life itself that you forgot to actually live it.   What a raw, beautiful and unflinching look into the world of the one percenters! This is NOT a pretty story - it is filled with lust and mayhem and violence - but it perfectly tells the story of Eva's parents, Preacher and Wheels (Debbie).   This is one of my top favorite series EVER and I highly recommend reading the books in order. BUT you can read the first book right away to get a flavor for Madeline Sheehan's writing.   Preacher lived an entire lifetime before we ever met Eva as a young child in 'Undeniable.' His life was hard. But he was a survivor.   ""Prison had been a painful wake-up call for Preacher. It had taken the man he'd been, beaten the holy hell out of him, flushed him down the shitter, and sputtered and spit him back out a ravaged and shameful shell.""   Preacher met Debbie on the road. She, too, was a survivor and did what she had to do to get by on the streets. Madeline Sheehan took two very damaged and hardened souls and created something beautiful which is why I absolutely love her writing style.   The book is told as a flashback as Preacher lays dying in the hospital. He is finally telling his story to his beloved daughter Eva. But everything I thought I knew about Preacher and Debbie was wrong! Preacher's tale is heartbreaking but I could not put this book down. I had to see it thought to the end.   Preacher was in the biker life no matter what. Loyal and true to his family and biker brothers no matter what, he was a Demon through and through.   ""According to the law and the state of New York, he was indeed a free man. But in reality, he wasn't free at all. He belonged to the Silver Demons body and soul, for better or worse. And if he stayed on this path, this wasn't going to be the last time he went to prison.""   Heart-wrenching and gritty, 'Undeserving' is nonetheless an incredibly readable story. It must be experienced. Madeline Sheehan does not write hearts-and-flowers stories. But her biker romances are must-reads. While this wasn't as raw as 'Undeniable', it is still one of the best examples of this genre. I can't wait for more books from Ms. Sheehan. She is one of my auto-buy authors.   Favorite quote:   ""I noticed you."" Debbie's eyes darted back inside the cart, colliding with Preacher's. I noticed you. Those three words took flight, finding and nudging awake long hidden places inside of her."
244	adjudicated	good	"4 - 4.5 Stars!!   WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!   This book picks up from the end of Book 1, and explores Weston pursuing Mirella. Please note that this is the second book in a trilogy and most definitely ends with an incredible cliffhanger! I found this book to be incredibly gripping, dealing with a taboo subject in an erotic, almost romantic way.   Ms. Roya's writing is charming and playful at times and almost addictive. I was absolutely fascinated by Weston and Gabe and was kept on the edge of my seat waiting for their marriages and their relationships to crash and burn.   ""We didn't learn from our mistakes. We just made them all over again.""   I found myself thinking about these characters even when I wasn't reading, which to me, is the sign of a good book. Mirella and Weston go back to their arrangement but Mirella lays down the new rule: their relationship is to be only physical, with no emotional attachment. Weston falling in love with her is what got them into trouble the first time around.   ""I shouldn't have let this all this get so out of control.""   This book is still told only from Mirella's POV but it delves more into describing Gabe and Weston's feelings. Bridget, however, is still very much a mystery. I would love to know more about her. In Book 2, the two couples try to have a ""normal"" relationship, which does require a suspended sense of reality, but I loved the way Ms. Roya explored the boundaries of their relationships. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop here, either by Gabe ending the open marriage arrangement or by Weston falling in love with Mirella all over again. I was not disappointed! This is an incredibly addictive story, and I can't wait for the next book in this trilogy. I am dying to read more about Gabe and Weston, two very passionate, sexy characters who each deserve their own book!   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"

Cover them with thick, numb tissue so we'll never have to fell that same pain again. The bottom of my stump is one big, hard callus   I absolutely adore Emma Chase! She is back with another super-sexy, witty and warm-hearted story that made me laugh at loud and tear up a bit.   Brent and Kennedy's story is sexy, funny, and completely endearing. Brent won me over and once again, Ms. Chase shows her skills at writing the male POV.   Brent Mason is a top lawyer and is totally surprised to see Kennedy Randolph again after many years. She was a sweet and nerdy girl who has now blossomed into a beautiful swan, who is also gorgeous, smart and his adversary in the courtroom.   Irresistible Brent sleeps around (a LOT) but never forgot his first love. Kennedy and Brent now face off in court in a high-profile case which added lots of opportunities for these two to really let the sparks fly. But it's the supporting cast of characters as well as the witty banter between these two that are central to this story. An interesting twist to the story is that Brent lost his leg in a childhood accident. He doesn't let this slow him down in ANY area of his life. This was a refreshing change of pace in an otherwise funny and sexy contemporary romance story.   Kennedy is scared of getting involved with Brent after all these years and the flashbacks to her teenage years, when she was bullied at school, are very poignant and form a stark contrast to the smart, successful attorney she is now. But Brent will stop at nothing to show Kennedy that she is the love of his life, and he is one determined guy!   ""...I collapse on top of her, my bones turned to Jell-o.   When the aftershocks eventually ebb, she laughs. That tinkling, magical laugh that sings of contentment and tugs up my own lips in a responding smile.   Now that - that is how you start a f-cking trial.""   Emma Chase's fans will eat this one up! Ms. Chase keeps up her winning streak with Appealed, a great entry in the Legal Briefs series.

51	adjudicated	average	I'm not sure if I love Khaled's characters (see my review of The Kite Runner), but the man can tell a story. I think all Americans need to read this book, as it helps to understand and sympathize with what the people in Afghanistan have gone through. Particularly interesting as the book spans 30+ years and paints a very graphic picture of how Afghanistan changed in that time. From Russian communists to warlords to the Taliban to US Army, there have been no shortage of invaders and wars, and victims. Khaled leaves out little of the misery and death, but also focuses on how life invariably always finds a way.   So a little sad, but I liked it. I think the thing I liked most was that I've read so few books about that area of the world, and now I feel like I've gotten to know it, just a tiny bit.
457	adjudicated	good	6 stars!!!! Archer's Voice absolutely blew me away! The characters, the setting, the story, the EMOTIONS, this book had everything I love about a great book. Mia Sheridan is a gifted and talented storyteller and Archer's Voice is at the top of my all-time favorite books. I absolutely fell in love with Archer, he has suffered unimaginable trauma and is closed off from the world. Along comes Bree and awakens his long-dormant feelings and his abilities to possibly become a whole person again. Archer is an intense, sometimes difficult character and my heart broke for him. Don't wait, Archer's Voice is a must-read!!   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
175	adjudicated	average	"You kidnapping me?   ""Only a little.""   I have heard amazing things about the first two books in this series so I couldn't wait to read I Everything I Left Unsaid. I did NOT feel lost reading this book even though I had not read the first two books. Max and June/Olivia are two incredible characters , and the writing is crisp, clean, intense and INCREDIBLY sexy.   June has a sister who is being held against her will by a cult. She dreams up a wild plan to rescue her which does not go according to plan and she ends up wounding and kidnapping Max, a dangerous MC President. Olivia is crazy about Max but he is a very dangerous man and can't be trusted. She brings him to her estranged aunt's house to recuperate from his wounds. The scenes in Florida at Aunt Fern's condo are priceless. And the slow burn starts to build between Olivia and Max, both damaged people who have led pretty sad and lonely lives.   ""Mutual assured destruction. You and I have sex, get involved in that way...both us burn. Both of us. We'll tear each other apart until there's nothing left to walk away from.""   Olivia is a loner and doesn't dare dream of ever being happy. She makes sure to sabotage anything good that comes into her life. The story itself is gritty, somewhat dark and definitely NOT your typical contemporary romance. There is no insta-love, and it takes quite a while for those two to get together. This book is VERY steamy and includes a sexy F/F scene that is incredibly hot. But the action, the scenes between Max and Olivia and the swoony scenes that eventually happened between Max and Olivia were all absolutely perfect. There is a wonderful Epilogue and I loved the conclusion that Ms. O'Keefe gave to these very troubled characters.   ""Save your act for other people. The lies and the show - I don't want it.

190	adjudicated	excellent	"4.5 Stars!!   Thank you, Joanna Wylde, for the fabulous Tinker Garrett!! She's a smart, feisty, funny heroine who isn't 20 years old. And Gage...HOLY HOTNESS!! Gage and Tinker's story was a hot and sweet slow burn romance, with the perfect amount of humor, depth and emotion.   I read a lot of MC stories and Joanna Wylde remains one of the best writers in this genre. The Reapers is one of my favorite MC series and I knew from the first few pages that this would be an exciting, witty and sexy story.   Gage is above all else loyal to his club. He hates his current undercover assignment, mainly because he has a fake girlfriend which is stopping him from claiming the stunning Tinker. The Club always comes before all else.   ""Reapers forever, forever Reapers.   Sometimes loyalty sucks.""   Tinker Garrett is certainly not Gage's usual ""type"" - she is smart, runs a thriving business, owns her own home and is taking care of her elderly father. Not the usual young girls Gage toys with. And I absolutely adored Tinker's best friend!! But Gage soon realizes he could have something real and beautiful with Tinker and he sets out to claim what's his.   I turned, catching the back of her head and pulling her in for a hard kiss, because fuck loyalty.   There is a lot going on in this book plot-wise, no question. But Ms. Wylde ties everything together AND really makes you CARE about the main characters. As always, the Washington State setting is perfect and well-researched. And can we talk about the ending and the fantastic Epilogue?? Both surprisingly sweet and sentimental, they added another level of emotional depth to an already great story.   REAPER'S FIRE is another fantastic, sexy and totally engrossing story from the talented Joanna Wylde.

497	adjudicated	average	Beat of the Heart is Book Two in the Runaway Train series and is a hot, sweet, entertaining and romantic book. AJ is the Latino drummer that we met in Book One. The ladies fall all over him but he is searching for something more meaningful. A chance meeting with nurse Mia might be just the cure for him. We are treated to lots of hot sexy times with AJ and Mia but will she let down her guard and let him in to her heart?   Mia is introduced to AJ's rock musician lifestyle and wonders if she can deal with his crazy lifestyle, even though she really does begin to develop deep feelings for him. I love books with a dual POV so this was a big plus for me. I also liked the fact that Mia is pretty much an average working woman and yet AJ sees her as beautiful, desirable and sexy.   Beat of the Heart is a fairly light, erotic and well written book. Ms. Ashley's writing style flows well and I cared about the characters. If you want a break from a heavy, angsty book, then Beat of the Heart is for you. Enjoy!   ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.
188	adjudicated	excellent	"Raine Miller has written another swoony, sexy, and beautiful story!! I fell in LOVE with Caleb!   I couldn't wait to read this new series from Raine Miller. Loosely connected to the Blackstone Affair series, the new Blackstone Dynasty introduces Caleb Blackstone, a wealthy businessman who is handsome, brilliant, driven, and of course, all alone. His life is filled with one-night stands and no permanence. He neither has the time or the interest in a lasting relationship. His family is wealthy and he does seems to have it all. Raine Miller writes an Alpha male like nobody's business and you can add Caleb Balckstone to the short list of handsome, passionate heroes.   Yes, there is some insta-love here BUT Raine Miller is a masterful writer and takes time to build her characters. When Caleb first sees the pretty Brooke, he smitten. Their later chance encounter at a party leaves a lasting impression on him. Little does he know that their families actually share a long history together. But Brooke, who is working several jobs, has ZERO interest in a serious relationship. She has suffered great loss in her life and was forced to leave her home England at a young age to live with her grandmother in America. Caleb and Brooke are both totally blind-sided by their mutual attraction.   ""Nothing was familiar when it came to Brooke. Each new thing we shared together felt to me as if I'd never done it before, and more importantly, as if I never wanted to do it again with anyone other than her--ever.""   I loved how Ms. Miller touched on the loneliness that both of her main characters felt. It was very poignant and made Caleb and Brooke's growing relationship all the more sweeter. I also adored how devoted Caleb was to Brooke and their passion together was INCREDIBLE! If you are looking for a beautifully written contemporary romance that is fairly low on the drama and angst, then 'Filthy Rich' is for you. The author made the New England setting come alive for me and I absolutely ADORE the cover of this book. The cover model Adam Cowie is THE perfect Caleb Blackstone.   While this book is a standalone, there will be another book coming in this series in February of 2017 for more about the Blackstone family!   ""When you find whatever it is that makes you happy, Caleb, hold on to it with everything you've got. Your heart will let you know.""

BLOOD TO DUST features a kick-ass heroine, a damaged hero and a story that will have you saying, ""Did I just read that??"" I became a huge fan of LJ Shen's after reading SPARROW and could not wait to get my hands on Prescott and Beat's story. She is hell-bent on revenge on a group of men who are dangerous, corrupt members of a crime family. They have ruined her family, and committed terrible crimes against her. The only problem is that she is being held against her will by them. She is outnumbered and defenseless. And of her captors is Beat.   Beat served time in prison with one of the men holding Prescott captive. He owes the a favor to one of the men, the sadistic and all-powerful Godfrey, and Beat (whose real name is Nate) just wants to fulfill his debt as soon as possible. Nate has committed murder in the past but he won't let any physical harm come to Prescott. As the captor and the captive spend more time together, Prescott and Nate begin to bond. Although he doesn't trust her at first (and rightfully so!), these two are kindred spirits who devise a plan to to repay their debts, seek vengeance and maybe, just maybe, find their own brand of happiness.   ""We're polar opposites. He's peace looking for color and I'm strorm looking for serenity.""   I love dark reads and I really liked this book (the author has a GREAT sense of humor) but felt the story spun out of control in some places. With that being said, Nate Vela is an unforgettable anti-hero!! Sensitive, strong, protective and damaged, I won't soon forget him. And Prescott is one of the strongest, most bad-ass heroines I have ever read. If you love a dark and gritty read, then you will love BLOOD TO DUST. I adore this author and can't wait to see what twisted story she comes up with next!   ""Tell me something beautiful,"" his lips speak into mine.   ""Us,"" I rasp.

I could not put it down. There are books that fulfill a certain reading mood, and this juicy story was just what I needed. I totally connected with Gillian and Jake, and more importantly, FELT their connection, too.   The chapter headings in this book are priceless and the story line was incredibly creative. Just when I thought the author was taking a predictable path, the plot veered off into unexpected territory. Our hero Jake is cold, distant and sarcastic, but boy can he fuck. He is a MACHINE. He has a woman waiting in every city. When our heroine Gillian meets him, they both agree to a strictly-sex arrangement. But of course you know that one of them is going to fall hard and get their heart broken. But it's what happens along the way that makes for a yummy, delicious, insanely addictive story. And oh my God, the sex in this book is burning hot. I mean this is totally NSFW, reading-under-the-covers kind of sex.   ""We'll always be fucking, Gillian"" He smiled, biting my lip before tossing me onto the bed. ""That's the best part of us.""   This book would have been 5 stars for me except for some minor details. It might seem clever to name characters after real authors, but to me, it cheapens the story. Many readers will recognize one of the main characters in this book but again, that detail lessened the impact of the story to me. Finally, proofreading would have helped to correct certain inconsistencies in the story.   BUT overall, I adored this book and completely devoured it!! I highly recommend TURBULENCE and can't wait for more from this author!   ""You're still my anomaly, Gillian,"" he said softly. ""You always will be."""

Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy write some of the best new adult romance today and they hit it out of park again (or made a goal??) with US. I fell in love all over again with Jamie Canning and Ryan Wesley. If you are looking to try a MM story, I highly recommend this series. It is pure romance!   Wes and Jamie are faced with the real-life pressures of a modern couple when Wes travels with his pro team and Jamie begins a job coaching. Added to the stress of their relationship is that fact that Wes is still hiding his relationship with Jamie. It pained me to suffer alongside both Wes and Jamie when they could not go public with their relationship. A sudden, devastating illness makes everything very clear to Wes and finally gives these two some of the normalcy that other couples enjoy. Leave it to these two authors to write an engaging, hot, funny and very sentimental story that shows the reader that love is for everyone.   I also adored Blake, who was funny and a true friend. Hello, he deserves his own book!! US is a wonderfully romantic and incredibly sexy story about two people in love. This book will have you cheering, laughing, clutching your heart and fanning yourself. What more can you ask for? Kudos to Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy for another beautiful story in this series.

253	adjudicated	average	Adorably sexy and very funny! This book is another fresh, modern, sexy and hilarious story from R.S. Grey.   The Allure of Dean Harper follows the story of Dean and Lily, the best friends of Julian and Jo from The Allure of Julian Lefray. Lily has just arrived in New York City and is opinionated, talented and very, very funny. She and Dean do not meet under the best of circumstances. Dean, a control freak and workaholic, arrives back from a business trip and his first meeting with his new bartender does not go well. The extremely talented Lily has been hired as a temporary bartender, and although she is incredible at her job, she immediately clashes with Dean and is actually fired right then and there.   From there, this funny enemies-to-lovers takes off into a fast-paced, behind-the-scenes peek into the competitive world of the restaurant business. Lily and Dean clearly are attracted to each other but they both bring out the worst in each other. Lily is outspoken and knowledgeable and I loved that she wouldn't back down from her opinions. Dean is driven, stubborn and very difficult. Their banter is witty and this story is the kind of book that R.S. Grey writes best. The scenes where Lily tries to adapt to life in the city are priceless.   This is a fast-paced, laugh-out-loud, classic enemies-to-lovers story. If you are looking for a modern, funny and light read, with a HEA, then you will love The Allure of Dean Harper!   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)

What I didn't expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book - and this book is not bad. It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide, which nothing can approach, but its not bad. My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didn't work for me.   The basic premise of the book is brilliant; that aliens have been listening to - and thus pirating - our music since 1977, without our knowledge. Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined $150,000 - this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity.   It's pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed. I think one of my favorite parts of the book was learning about the law firm that Nick Carter works for, and seeing a little under the hood of how they operate.   Overall a fun, enjoyable read.

We've all got a little bit of good and evil in us.   IT ENDS WITH US is one of THE most important books you'll read this year, maybe ever. It is absolutely stunning. There are very few books that I recommend to my daughter to read but this book is one of them. This story should be read by every woman, husband, boyfriend, son and brother because it contains one of the most powerful messages I have ever experienced.   On the surface this book is the story of Lily, who has escaped to Boston from the small town she grew up in. Smart and driven, she opens her own shop and meets Ryle, a funny, handsome and brilliant surgeon. Revealing anything more about this book would do a tremendous disservice to the perfect way that Colleen Hoover has told this story. It builds slowly, bit by bit, to a painful and inevitable conclusion that took my breath away.   As with all Colleen Hoover's books, IT ENDS WITH US is a stunner, magnificently written and absolutely unputdownable. My heart almost stopped in several places. It's that good!! Do yourself a favor and read this book - you will never forget it.   ""Fifteen seconds. That's all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we'll never get back.""   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"

Joss is trying to move on with her life after the sudden death if her beloved husband. Little does she know that his best friend Dash has always been in love with her but never acted on his feelings out of loyalty to his best friend and Joss' husband. Sparks literally fly when she walks into Dash's D/s club one night, and he realizes she is looking to be in a submissive relationship. He is shocked but thrilled at the possibility of a relationship with her.   Maya Banks can write hot and steamy sex scenes like nobody's business! Wowser! What was beautiful about the story is that Dash and Joss had a deep connection before they have sex and there is a slow and gradual build-up to their scenes together. I loved when Joss really ""saw"" Dash for the first time as a man and a sexual partner, instead of the best friend of her husband. It was breathtaking.   The sex scenes are totally hot and the anal play scenes are absolutely among the hottest I have ever read! There is a fabulous Epilogue and no cliffhanger, but there will definitely be more books in this series about Joss and Dash's friends. Can't wait for more from Maya Banks!

Fascinating characters, a timely storyline and SUPER-hot steamy scenes make this book a winner!! R.S. Grey shows that she can write a great adult romance with this story. With the 2016 Summer Olympics right around the corner, this book about Olympic athletes hits all the right notes. Plus, it offers an intimate look into the often-isolated life of an elite gymnast.   ""I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. In gymnastics, if you're good, you're lonely.""   Brie Watson is the Cinderella story of the international gymnastic world. She and her mother have sacrificed EVERYTHING to get her to the Summer Games. And her coach Erik Winter knows all too well the pressures she is under, having suddenly dropped out of competitive athletics when he was at the top of his game. They are kindred souls, even though they fight constantly and even in the face of Erik's apparent iciness towards her.   ""She was fierce; she wanted to be seen, and not just for her gymnastics skills. No, she wanted to be desired. Coveted. Craved. Had anyone ever touched her the way she wanted to be touched?""   This might be THE sexiest book yet from Ms. Grey. The passion between the hero and heroine literally lept off the pages!! I absolutely love the enemies-to-friends trope and it is done to perfection here.   ""Toying with Brie was quickly becoming my favorite pastime and a part of me wondered why I was doing it. Yes, she was disrespectful and constantly talked back during practice, but she was hardly the first strong-headed girl in my gym to be guilty of that. No, I was enjoying her punishment a little too much.""   OUT OF BOUNDS has the perfect blend of intense sports scenes, sexy, adult romance and emotion. There's no unnecessary drama here, just a perfectly readable, hot romance with a fantastic cast of characters. Even if you're not a fan of sports romance, give this one a try. You will fall in LOVE with Brie Watson and Erik Winter!   Favorite quote:   ""She wanted to be someone's voice when they were beaten down, lost, forgotten--but now it was my turn to stand up for her. She deserved a better life and I wouldn't let myself rest until I gave it to her.""   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"

Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy have become two of my favorite authors!!   I read a fair amount of M/M romance books, so I approached HIM with a wary eye. Would it have enough steam for me? Would the two heroes only dance around their attraction for each other, but never really get down to business? Would the dialogue be witty enough to hold my pathetically short attention span?   The answer to all these questions is a resounding YES!!   Because I adored Elle Kennedy's Off Campus series and loved Sarina Bowen's The Shameless Hour, I was thrilled to be able to read their collaboration together. And once I started reading HIM, I literally could NOT put this book down! Jamie Canning and Ryan 'Wes' Wesley were perfectly real characters to me and the writing style so seamless, that I could not tell which author wrote which chapter, scene or verse. Even if you're new to the M/M genre, I highly recommend this book for the witty banter, sexy times and catchy plot. Two hot hockey players? Yes please!!   Jamie and Wes were childhood friends who lost touch after a youthful incident that caused an unfortunate miscommunication. Lo and behold, they run into each other years later and both realize that they have been the ""missing link"" in each other's lives. But does Jamie just want to be friends with Wes? Set among the world of college hockey, HIM delivers the perfect amount of hot, dirty, sweet emotion as both Wes and Jamie learn to come to terms with their true feelings. Wes has always loved Jamie and finds it difficult to keep their relationship platonic.   ""As I watch Jamie Canning stop another dizzying slap shot. As I admire the grace and deadly precision with which he moves.   My weakness is him.""   I absolutely LOVED how the authors wrote a seamless story that perfectly illustrated the difficulties that gay sports players must face. Wes and Jamie were perfectly suited for each other, even if Jamie at first was reluctant to admit his true feelings for Wes. And Wes, on the other hand, is a total commitment-phone, never allowing anyone to get too close, and hopping from meaningless encounter to another.   ""The fact that he'd been the first guy I ever loved and the one who made me face some terrifying things about myself...well, all that will go unsaid.""   HIM is a feel-good sports romance that happens to feature two fabulously sexy male protagonists. It is perfect for die-hard readers of M/M romance as well as for readers who are new to the genre. I adored this book and hope that Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy collaborate on many more books in the future!   (I received an ARC in return for an honest review.)"
444	adjudicated	average	4.5 stars!! THROTTLE ME is another super-hot, sexy and delicious book from Chelle Bliss. Her books always have such a sense of heart and family infused into the smexy-ness of the story that they truly are a treat to read. I absolutely loved City - could he be ANY hotter?? - and the object of his lust, the very endearing schoolteacher, Suzy (or Suzette, City likes to use her real name and not her nickname). Often I read erotic romance that is rushed, empty, almost soulless, and Throttle Me is the compete opposite: a steamy, tattooed hot guy who has had his share of meaningless hook-ups but who has a real sense of romance, love and family.   Tattooed, motorcycle-riding Alpha bad boy? Check. Smart, hard-working, sweet woman who is just getting her first taste of really mind-blowing sex? Check. Well-written cast of supporting characters? Check! (Hello, Gallo brothers!) There are no billionaires here, no young, blushing virgin. What I have always loved about Chelle's books are that the characters and everyday, working people, looking for love and having some super-hot sexy times along the way.   I loved Throttle Me and can't wait for more books in this series!!   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)

Ann has become my new favorite author!! I DEVOURED the Jack & Jill Series, and One features two characters from that series. Although this book can technically be read as a standalone, PLEASE PLEASE read the unforgettable books in the Jack & Jill Series first because there are some major spoilers. The author calls this genre Romantic Comedy but it so much more! Swoony romance, funny dialogue, dramatic moments and SEXY scenes...Cage and Lake are two very memorable characters.   Lake became an amputee after a tragic car accident that took the life of her fiancee. She has moved away from her family in California to Minneapolis, where she once again runs into the football star Cage, with whom she once shared an unforgettable kiss. She cat get Cage out of her head and cant believe he remembers her, too. Cage really sees Lake, not her disability, and she can't get him out of head.   ""Mind if I lose the leg?"" I asked.   He shook his head. There really were no words to describe how his lack of any sort of reaction made me feel.   Not one flinch.   Not one nervous glance at my leg.   Not one second of hesitation.   Cage is sexy, warm and loving. He falls fast for Lake, who is impulsive, funny, a little insecure and very, very honest. She makes a living by testing artificial limbs, and her work takes her all over the world. A trip to China provides one of the BEST scenes in the whole book!! It is so hard to categorize any of Jewel E. Ann's books, they really cover all the bases and I ended up highlighting half this book.   ""My mouth said thank you, but my heart said I love you.""   Lake is quickly thrust into the world of NFL pro football and things aren't always easy. Her family makes an appearance in this book and they are always there to support her. There are some very dramatic moments in this book which provided some very unexpected and very surprising twists, as only this author can do. The supporting characters are, as always, absolutely fantastic (Flint! Hello!! Would love to read your story!!) Warm, sexy and laugh-out-loud funny, ONE is another home run from this amazing author.   ""Give me you. Give me every tear. Give me every breath. Give me every fear. Give me every touch. Give me every smile. Give me every day.""   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
386	adjudicated	average	4 frothy and delicious stars!! Loved this swoony, very romantic story!!   I absolutely love Melanie Harlow's Frenched Series! The heroines are strong, witty, sexy and very relatable. Coco is thrown together with her ex, Nick, a well-known chef who broke her heart years before. She has never really gotten over him and it seems that even though he broke up with her, he isn't over her, either. Melanie French writes sexy heroes who have a heart of gold, a strong romantic streak and who aren't afraid of strong women. The sex scenes in this book are UBER-hot and sweetly romantic at the same time.   Sometimes you need a sexy, light and super-romantic book in between some of the darker, heavier reads, and Forked fits the bill perfectly. Put Nick and Coco on your reading menu, you won't be disappointed!   (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review)
294	adjudicated	good	"I love Chelle Bliss and was so excited to read her newest series! If you've read Men of Inked, then you will fall head over heels in love with Morgan (NICE NAME!!) DeLuca, a Gallo cousin and Alpha male extraordinaire. He is just out of the Army and looking for direction in life when he gets an offer from his Florida cousins to join the ALFA PI agency. He picks up and leaves Chicago and his meddling mother to start over again with a new job.   I loved how the Gallo family is woven into this story. If you haven't read Chelle's Men of Ink series, you are missing out! They are filled with love, big families, snappy banter and lots and lots of mind-blowing sexy times. Get right on that!   Sinful Intent is a fast-paced, steamy story involving Morgan's first job, investigating and protecting his first client, Race True, from harassing and threatening emails that have escalated. She is being blackmailed and he must find her tormenter. She is a buttoned-up, straight-laced corporate type, sexy but basically married to her job and she needs someone like Morgan in her life to add the spontaneity she has been sorely missing out on.   Chelle's books are steamy, entertaining and have some of the most creative sex scenes I have ever read. Morgan is just, WOW. Race and Morgan together are just explosive. I liked the suspense and mystery along with the funny moments sprinkled throughout the book. I really enjoyed this book. It is overall a very enjoyable, sexy story and a great start to a new series by one of my favorite authors.   Favorite Quotes:   ""We all have scars. Some we can see and others we can't. Wear those with pride.""   ""In all honesty, I hadn't saved Race True. She'd saved me. Giving me a life full of love and everything I'd always needed but never knew I'd wanted.""

I still craved that feeling, that closeness, and I sought it out as often as I could. I wasn't picky about who I slept with--older, younger, attractive, homely, mothers, girlfriends, wives. Who they were didn't matter to me, I only cared that they were interested. That probably wasn't the best thing to admit, but it was the truth. Sex was a release for me. It made me feel like a part of something bigger than myself, made me feel connected to the world around me. And I needed to feel that way. My life was full of empty spaces.""   And so begins this unexpectedly sexy and compelling book told from Kellan Kyle's POV. Forget that you think you know Kellan and Kiera's story, Thoughtful is a fresh and emotional story and is an absolute must-read!!   This book is a tribute to the fantastic talent that is S.C. Stephens. Kellan's voice is very male, very original and very, very sexy! My heart once again ached for him as we were given a peak inside his head and inside his heart. This story gives us insight into Kellan and Kiera's undeniable attraction, the heartache they both experienced and some amazing sexy times between the two of them. It is painful but compelling and I could not put this book down.   ""For a brief second, I wondered what she really thought about me. Did she know anything about me besides my name and that I was in a band? Did she realize I screamed my heart out in my lyrics? Did she understand that my life left me feeling vacant inside? That I was so fucking lonely I almost couldn't stand myself? Would she want to know any of that? Or was the fact that I was a ""rock star"" enough for her? Like it was for all the other girls I'd slept with.""   I absolutely loved the music scenes and they are an integral part of this book. I literally swooned all over again reading Thoughtful.   ""When it was time for us to go play, a familiar feeling washed over me--anxiousness mixed with peace. As I walked up the steps to the stage worn with use, I felt the remnants of who I was melting off me. Onstage, none of my worries touched me. It was like I was a different person. Like I was acting, and yet I was being more truthful than I ever was off the stage. I bled my heart out while I was performing, not that many people truly noticed; they were too busy enjoying the showmanship to dig beneath the surface of the words. There was safety in the scrutiny, anonymity in the spotlight. I felt invincible up there. Just me and my guitar.""   The loneliness, the pain of first love...it is all here and more. Thoughtful is a must-read and I applaud the author for giving us an amazingly fresh and new look at the irresistible Kellan Kyle. Thoughtful is must-read! Enjoy!"
258	adjudicated	good	"Tell me what happened nine years ago, when you left to go back home and forget all about Barcelona. And me.   SIGH! A smart, modern, contemporary romance that was pure pleasure from beginning to end! Avery is newly arrived in Rome, reeling from a disastrous marriage where she's actually felt stifled and trapped for some time. Avery reconnects in Rome with an old friend AND with an old flame. Her boyfriend from a summer abroad in Europe is also in Rome. Marcelo has never forgotten Avery, and and has always wondered why she left Europe that summer so suddenly so many years before.   Avery has always played by others' rules: she married because it was the right thing to do, led a certain life because it was emptied of her, but here in Rome, with her friend Daisy, she is really free for the first time in her life to be her own woman. And Marcello still finds her beautiful and sexy and talented and they begin a gorgeous romance set against the stunning beauty of Italy.   ""For the first time in a very long time, I felt treasured.""   Fans of second-chance romance will devour this love story and revel in the stunning European settings! And who could resist falling in love against the incredibly exciting backdrop of Rome? This book is pure magic. There is just the right amount of drama and I adored the intelligent and supportive secondary characters. Kudos to Nina Bocci for a fabulous debut book! And remember, it is never too late to start something new or make a chance in your life. Just go for it!   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"
309	adjudicated	average	do not read much paranormal romance but I highly recommend this book! The characters and the story won me over. Mitch and Frederick are twins and both alpha wolves. Mitch stayed in their area, even after his brother found a mate and even though he accepted that he would forever be alone.   Frederick and Simon meet by chance and once again, Cardeno C.'s incredibly loving, warm and sweet style took over to give these two the full life they had both been missing.   Blue Mountain is a fairly short story, but is a wonderful, sweet addition to the author's work. Although Simon and Frederick are only really together towards the end of the story, the story and the characters really mesh perfectly together and I loved the direction the story took. I absolutely adored the narrator of this audiobook, even though I liked him best as the voice for Frederick and Mitch. I would like to hear Sean Crisden again as the narrator in future audiobooks. I highly recommend this story and the audio book for any reader of the m/m genre, even those new to the shapeshifter genre. Thank you, Cardeno C. for broadening my reading horizons once again!   (A complimentary copy of the audiobook was provided in exchange for an honest review.)

131	adjudicated	average	"Love the Reapers books so I was excited to read this when it released as part of the 1001 Dark Nights series. Joanna Wylde's writing is smart, funny and sexy. I love how Shade goes after Mandy but only claims her when he's sure she's in it all the way. Mandy's had her eye on Shade but didn't make a move because she already had a boyfriend, who was a total loser.   ""When I first met Rebel, I'd teased him about having a crush on Shade because my new boyfriend couldn't stop talking about the man. Then I'd met Shade in person. Now I got it. Rebel worked hard to make sure everyone knew he was a big, bad biker. Shade didn't have to work at it. He just was big and bad.""   Joanna Wylde's MC books are among my favorite stories and this story reminded me why I love her so much. Her women are strong, resilient and tough as nails. Not to mention down-to-earth and self-deprecating. Mandy can't resist the allure of Shade, the President of the Reaper's MC, even though she is conned into being alone with him for the first time.   ""He was the biggest, nastiest bastard in the room--not to mention easy on the eyes--and deep down inside I just knew we'd make beautiful babies together. Too bad I already sort of had a boyfriend... Shade was so potent we'd probably have quintuplets or something crazy on the first try. You don't even want a baby, I reminded my quivering ovaries. Jump him! Jump him and ride him like a cowgirl! they snapped back. Just think how sexy and strong he is. His sperm could kick Rebel's ass and you know it!""   Shade is NOT looking for an ""old lady,"" or even anything more than a one night stand. He makes this very clear to Mandy. Which is fine with her, because she has had nothing but rotten luck with her previous boyfriends.   ""Girls wanted flowers and roses and forever. I wanted the road under my tires and something new on the horizon. Never understood why so many of my brothers were willing to settle down in one place. I wasn't that guy. Never had been. Never would be.""   There's lots of action and lots of steamy, dirty scenes and just lots of fun in this story. I adore Joanna Wylde and this story satisfied my craving for her MC stories. Loved visiting with the Reapers MC again. 'Shade's Lady' was a witty, funny, sexy and fast read. Highly recommend for all fans of MC romance.

ROOKIE MOVER has everything I love about Sarina Bowen's books: great writing, smart women, fine and sexxxy hockey players, and sweet, sweet first love.   Georgia and Leo have been apart for years after having been in love when they were in high school. Now Leo is the new trade for the Brooklyn Bruisers hockey team, where his former girlfriend is also working. Leo has never gotten over Georgia, and even though she was the one who broke up with Leo, she has never gotten over him, either. She has followed his career and now is face to face again with her one true love.   Ah, Leo. Georgia's happiness was all he ever cared about. His past with Georgia might keep him from reaching his full potential with the team, but he will never betray her secrets. He is a sexy, sweet, talented hockey player who brings just the right amount of steam and sweetness to this book. It's obvious these two still care for each other and their chemistry still burns bright after all these years have passed.   ""So fucking good,"" ...   ""Now give me that mouth.""   Sarina Bowen writes some of THE best sports romances around. There are great supporting characters in this book, and I'm thrilled that the next book will be O'Doul's story. ROOKIE MOVE is a fantastic start to the new Brooklyn Bruisers series! Highly recommended for all fans of sweet, steamy second-chance romances.   ""You and I don't have one-night stands.

Told in dual POV's, Ricochet pulled me in from the first page and was one of those books that I could not put down. The storyline is very fresh, very original and very, very violent and dark. Which I totally loved.   Nick is hell-bent on the revenge of his family's violent death and Aubree is a pawn in his scheme. But she is trapped in a hellish world of her own, in a marriage to a sadistic, powerful man from whom she is all to relieved to escape.   Even before Nick abducts her, Aubree is fascinated with a mysterious masked man who warns Detroit's ruling elite that the city's criminal element is coming down:   ""I'd become obsessed with him just the same. Behind that mask was a mastermind of the most notorious computer hacks the city had ever known. His bold threats, his willingness to take on my psychopathic husband, had turned him into my own personal fantasy.   Is Nick the same, myserious dark avenger? Ricochet is not your average dark-romance kidnap story. Nick is cruel to Aubree but she slowly becomes obsessed with him, and he with her. Even though she started out as just a faceless pawn in his game.   ""I'd fallen in lust with a complete stranger, strictly on the basis that he happened to scare the shit out of my husband.   Aubree sees the hurt and pain behind Nick's rage and he slowly realizes that Aubree has suffered as well:   ""I saw darkness in her beauty, and she saw beauty in my darkness. Yin and yang. Black and white. Beauty and scars; fury and forgiveness. She should've been my nemesis, but in her, I found something I didn't know I was looking for.""   The law of the streets rule in this book and the action is gritty and unrelenting. And there is a HUGE twist at the end that I did not see coming. Ricochet is a great fast-paced, emotional, gritty and VERY sexy read that I highly recommend."

But at the same time, I feel like if I could live through that, what happened to us, then I can survive anything. Like, what is there really to be afraid of?   This book has SO much going for it! A Bittersweet, friends-to-lovers story; a feisty and relatable heroine; AND a bad-boy hero. Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and 'Lick' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I'm so glad that I did. Edie is VERY different from most fictional heroines and for that, I applaud Ms. Scott. For once, the ordinary girl gets the guy!   ""Kissing John was everything. Well, not everything everything. I wouldn't die without him. But all of me wanted him, my heart and my head and all of the rest. Without a doubt, he made life better.""   John and Edie experienced a life-changing trauma and it pretty much bonds them together. No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end.   ""You're here?""   ""Yeah.""   ""Why?""   ""Because this is where you are,"" he said, as if it were obvious.   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"

88	adjudicated	excellent	"Out of all the places we could be, we're right here. At the same time.   Colleen Hoover is at the top of my auto-buy list. Without question. And she returns to her Young Adult stories in 'Without Merit'. Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood, lives in a very unconventional household. From her perspective, her family is just plain WEIRD. No one can seem to get along and most poignantly, no one really seems to notice Merit at all. She almost seems like an afterthought.   ""I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town. I say house because it is certainly not a home. And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants. No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia.   Of course, Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges. Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care. She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first.   Merit decides to just stop attending school. No one seems to even notice! While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earth-shattering kiss. BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan, her twin's boyfriend. It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor.   Merit is angry and surly and can't seem to make many friends. She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in. How could this have happened?   ""I'm confused by two things. One being the constant and repeated presence of Honor's boyfriend at our breakfast table. Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that they're perfectly fine with him joining in on the family conversation.   Merit eventually uncovers some very hard truths about her family's past. It also becomes very clear that Honor is not the perfect person that she at first thinks herself to be. Like all of Colleen Hoover's characters, Merit is unforgettable. She must make some hard choices about herself, her family and Sagan.   ""Sagan just doesn't say mean things out loud. Maybe that's a product of how he was raised. Or maybe he's some kind of saint. Or an angel brought to earth to test my morals.""   I loved the message of this book!! The story is beautiful and the characters feel real and flawed and very relatable. The description of small-town Texas seems spot-on. Fans of Colleen Hoover will devour this story, and hopefully new readers will pick this one up and see why her readers are so devoted to her writing. Unconditional love, loyalty and forgiveness are some heavy topics but Ms. Hoover serves them up perfectly here.   ""Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing a mistake deserves is forgiveness.""   ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review."

I did not read any reviews of this book before I started reading it and I am so glad I had no idea about this story other than the synopsis, so I will keep this spoiler-free. Pepper has created two of the most memorable characters I have ever read and even now I can't stop thinking about Hazel and Fox.   This is a dark, dark journey, but hold out and keep reading because the author makes it worth your while. Our hero and heroine meet under very harsh circumstances and their story is a raw, gritty and emotional journey like no other. Yes, the sex scenes are incredibly steamy, but they are infused with a rawness and pain that is at times difficult to witness:   ""It was the best kiss I'd ever received, but also the worst. It sparked lust and need in every inch of me. My lips wanted more, my tongue wanted savagery. My skin wanted to bruise because he needed to touch me so badly.   All my thoughts disappeared as I nipped at his bottom lip. He flinched, but a second later he copied, his sharp canines piercing my oversensitive flesh.   I moaned.   I couldn't take it.   My hands flew up and gripped his shirt. Yanking him toward me, fireworks whizzed in my fingertips; my heart galloped toward exploding with lust. I'd never been so drunk on someone before.   Then I landed flat on my back.   The crack of my skull jangled my teeth. The thick carpet did little to cushion me. My eyes flared wide and I grunted in pain. Fear, hot and terrible, swamped my lust in a dampening wave.   ""Top rule. Unbreakable rule. Don't. Ever. Touch. Me."" Fox kneeled on one knee beside my head, breathing hard. His hand noosed my throat, pressing my spine into the carpet. His eyes were cold and lifeless, looking like a hunter intent on blood."" - HAZEL   My heart went out to both of them and especially Fox, he was a fighter, hiding his fractured soul behind a stony, murderous facade:   ""Fox made a sound in the back of his throat, tightening his fingers. He glared, looking ready to murder me. ""Who are you?"" His eyes darted over me as if looking for an answer.   When I didn't respond, he swiped his face with his other hand. His forehead furrowed while his expression turned pissed and stormy. ""You think I didn't see you watching? You had your eyes all over me. Answer me. Who the fuck are you?"" His deep, accented voice stiffened my nipples even as a thrill of fear jolted through me.   My temper gave me false courage. ""I'm not in the habit of answering such rude questions."" -- HAZEL   I absolutely loved the dual POV's, which are very difficult to do well, but Pepper does an amazing job at getting the reader into these character's heads. Destroyed was an absolute 5-star read for me. I do hope, however, that the small editing and grammatical will be corrected. Otherwise, Destroyed is another fantastic and completely original story from the very talented Pepper Winters.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"

I loved the whole undercover cop story and my word, Bowen is HOT!! And that's saying a lot for a TB hero. He is right up there with the dirtiest-talking alphas EVER. This story is fact-paced, action-filled and has tons and tons of heat, tension and sexy times. TB's books literally melt your Kindle and Risking It All is one of her hottest books ever.   Favorite quote in the book:   ""We both know it's only a matter of time before I'm pounding the purity right out of you.""   RIA is a passionate mix of romance and action and I highly recommend it for all fans of Ms. Tessa Bailey!!   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"
215	adjudicated	excellent	"4.5 STARS!!   NAZ IS BACK and wicked as ever.   I am in love with this series!!! The author continues to surprise by showing a ""little"" softer side of Naz here. Just a little. He is still as ruthless as ever but he remains fiercely loyal to Karissa. He stuggles to break free of his violent past for Karissa's sake, but let's face it, it is obvious he will never be completely free of that world. For that reason, I was on the edge of my seat throughout this whole book, just waiting for the other shoe to drop.   ""He wants to be a better man to ease my guilt for loving someone like him.""   This is a fast-moving, thrilling and violent plot, but completely and utterly sexy at the same time. Naz is absolutely one of THE sexiest, most controlling anti-heroes and I love him!!! This series is a must-read for fans of Mafia romance. It is tighly written, fast-paced, totally sexy and has great supporting characters. There is lots going on in this book and obviously the series must be read in order or there will be major spoilers.   J.M. Darhower is one of my go-to authors and this book delivers the goods. Buckle up and get ready for a bumpy ride!!   (Many thanks to the author for the review copy.)"

The story begins right after Found in You ends and launches right into more delicious romance and intense chemistry between Alayna and Hudson. I loved this attentive and romantic side of Hudson!   ""No. This is better than a beginning. This is what happens next."" - Hudson   There are still lots of external forces conspiring to drive a wedge between these new lovers' relationship. PLus, Alayna has her own demons to deal with which make her behaviour at times vert maddening! This book inspired a lot of emotion in me and I was really worried that she would be the one to drive the two of them apart:   ""He'd told me once that he would always be manioulative and domineering, even when he wasn't playing games. It was who he was. Me, I would always be obssessive. I'd always question. Even when I was healthy. Asking to forget about this was defying my nature."" - Alayna   Hudson does all that he can possibly do under the circumstances to persuade Laynie that his feelings for her are genuine and real. But her obsessive nature bubbles to the surface on more than one occassion.   Hudson also seems to be keeping something from Laynie despite their promises to be completely honest and open with each other. There is a very compelling storyline here that is very creative and emotional. At times, I feared that Hudson's behavior, not Laynie's, would destroy their relationship. I don't want to give any spoilers away but rest assured that this book is packed with some totally HOT sex scenes and a fantastic storyline. It is a fabulous conclusion to the series! I highyl recommend this yummy trilogy and I hope there will be more written about these characters in the future.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
122	adjudicated	average	3.5 Stars   'Bombshell' was not quite for me, but was an engaging and verrrry sexy romance. I adore C.D. Reiss's writing and I know that not every book is for every reader. SO, although I love her trademark staccato-style of writing, it just didn't work for me here. This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay, which is fine, but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me.   I didn't really connect with the MC's until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them, but BETWEEN them. And the near-constant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me. Would this make a cute movie? Absolutely. It just didn't work for me as a romance novel.   The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me. I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole. I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars. C.D. Reiss continues to be one of my favorite romance authors and I will always read what this woman writes!   (ARC provided by Montlake in return for an honest review.)
500	adjudicated	average	"Sometimes a book comes along that grabs you from the first page and doesn't let you go. Making faces is one of those books. Perfectly written, emotional and tragic, but funny and beautiful all at once. Just like life. Amy Harmon has a gift for storytelling and character development and has created a book that will stay with you long after you finish. This book is a must-read, your life will be all the richer for reading it.   Fern has been the plain girl for most of her life, the quiet kind of girl who fades into the background. She has an incredibly close bond with her cousin, and with him and Ambrose, form the heart of this story.   Fern, Ambrose and Bailey all attended high school together and Fern loved Amborse from afar. Ambrose was the star wrestler and had his pick of the prettiest girls. The way Amy Harmon writes about high school was incredibly funny and painful at the same time. But then after graduation, Ambrose leaves for Iraq and returns a very changed man.   ""Sometimes you can't take your life back. Sometimes it's dead and buried and you can only make a new life. Ambrose didn't know what that life would look like.""   For the first time, he really gets to know Fern and sees her true inner beauty. But Fern is still incredibly insecure about her outward appearance, and is desperate to have Ambrose really desire her as a beautiful woman.   ""But I would really like it if, for once, I could be beautiful on the outside.""   The journey these characters take is unforgettable. Do not miss Making Faces. Amy Harmon's incredible story is ultimately uplifting, beautiful and hopeful. Do not miss this book!"
21	adjudicated	average	A fun fast paced book that sucks you in right away and doesn't let go. The remnants of humanity live in a 150 story silo below the earth and can't leave as the outside is now toxic. This is a bit of an odd thing to have happened, but it gives us a nice palette to think about things.   Everything is rationed, including how many children you can have. People self-identify by their profession and where in the silo they live: farmers and mechanics in the lowers, IT in the mids, and professional class in the uppers. The working class wear color coded uniforms to easily distinguish them.   The book was a lot about control. How to control a contained civilization, and give them hope (eg a live feed of the outside) and yet keep them in harmony and doing their functions. Strange mechanisms of control were built all over the silo: communication was oddly limited given the IT resources they have - many messages had to be delivered by courier as emails cost valuable money to send. Most strange of all - there is no elevator, which forces anyone wanting to travel the length of the silo to spend 2-3 days on the journey.   The cleaning ritual was a strange bit of culture. (view spoiler)[Upon reflection, I can see why it was necessary. If people never go outside, uncertainty of it still being bad would creep in, and people would need to try it. As perhaps happened in Silo 17. (hide spoiler)]   I really liked the unraveling of Bernard, and how he went from repulsive/annoying, to understandable once you understood his role and responsibility. (view spoiler)[His role is to eliminate any doubt in the delicate balance of the silo. Opening the book up with the doubt of Holston was brilliant as it sucked you in immediately. (hide spoiler)]   I liked Juliet too - she was the right combo of being determined to do right, and having brains and grit.
189	adjudicated	average	Another warm, romantic and totally hot story!!   I have a confession: I am addicted to Alexa Riley's books! They are quick, sexy, and always well-written. The heroes are devoted to their women and the heroines love every second of it. There's always a HEA in the world of Alexa Riley!!
72	adjudicated	average	After seeing the movie (i liked it), and needing a fun read for a vacation, this was perfect. Like Jacques, I loved the explanation of Baccarat. My mental image of Vesper Lynd in the book is much prettier than the actress from the movie. Fleming's Bond is much more of a connoisseur than the movie Bond, and he takes great care in describing all the details of the things he enjoys - particularly his cigarettes, his food, his wine, and his car.
107	adjudicated	poor	4.5 Stars!!   LOVED this sexy-sweet and romantic story!! I fell in love with the characters in this book and absolutely LOVE this author!! I knew from the first page that I would love this romance. Highly recommend. Full review to follow.
271	adjudicated	average	Loved the newest book from one of my favorite authors! This book has it all: world-famous rock stars, SMOKING hot sex, and a very engaging storyline. And we get to visit with some of our favorite Sinners.   I have devoured all of Ms. Cunning's previous books, I mean, who doesn't love the mega-hot rockers of the Sinners on Tour series? Those were among the first books I read when I started reading romance. And the new Exodus End book doesn't disappoint in the steam department, this book has everything and more in the sexytimes department.   Ms. Cunning once again writes an immensely readable and incredibly HAWT story, this time involving the virginal and very sweet Toni who is hired to write an interactive biography of the band. Something about her attracts Logan, the sexy, Mr. Hot Rocker, who actually finds her innocence an incredible turn-on! Their scenes together are, um, breathtaking and will leave you with a new respect for there writing talents of Olivia Cunning.   There is a very sweet story involving Toni's family life, she is leaving behind her special needs sister to go on tour with Exodus End. Her mother is the owner of publishing company that Toni works for andI loved the tension between her mother and Toni over the company. There is lots of drama involving a co-worker who does't have Toni's best interests at heart.   Our favorite Sinners all make appearances here and it was great meeting up with them again,   But the heart of this story is the wonderful sexual awakening of Toni and the hands of Logan, I mean, Olivia Cunning can write a sex scene like no other! Toni is very endearing and not your typical flashy, sexy groupie that Logan would normally go for. Their scenes together also have a lot of heart to them. I adored this first book in the Exodus End series and I can't wait to read about the other band members! I hope there will be more!   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
349	adjudicated	good	4.5 stars! Wow. This book will stay with me for a very long time. Full review to come.
436	adjudicated	excellent	4.5 stars!!   I love picking up a book and being totally surprised and enthralled by a new author. I could not put down Besieged once I started. It is uber-sexy, scorchingly hot, but with a fantastic story that kept my attention until the last page and left me dying for more from this author! Warning: the build up to these two having sex is just as hot as when they actually get together and this book requires a cold shower or two! My favorite kind of book!   Theo is a wealthy London businessman and Lilly works for his solicitor (lawyer in the U.S.). She's smart, sarcastic, funny and drop-dead sexy. Alhtough this might sound a tad familiar, the author really does a great job with Lilly and Theo's story as well as with making the city of London a character in the book. I absolutely loved the club scenes as well as the well-written supporting cast of family and friends.   Lilly and Theo have some F***-HOT scenes and they literally cannot keep their hands off each other. Theo is a confirmed bachelor, he has never even wanted to spend any time at all with a woman, let alone commit to anyone. Lilly only uses guys for sex, so they enter into a no-strings-attached sexual relationship. But Lilly makes Theo fight for her at first, she's stubborn, feisty and also very funny.   She's no pushover and is painfully aware of his player status.   Theo can't resist Lilly and what I loved about him is that he is totally honest with her. When he begins to develop real feelings for her, he puts himself on the line and does not play games.   Never have I gone to such lengths over a woman. I'm having to convince her that she wants me for god's sake. I close my eyes and I can hear her moaning as I taste that sweet pussy of hers. Her cries as she trembles against my tongue. Oh god. My cock stiffens immediately at the memory.   I realise that now I know what it is to have her...I can't go back. I will fight for her, no matter what.   All in all, I highly recommend this fantastic, sexy debut by L.P. Lovell. It's modern, totally hot and has characters that I really care about and who I really bonded with. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star read for me was the pacing and editing which will probably go unnoticed by most readers but interrupted the flow for me. I was thrilled to read that this author will be paying closer attention next time and I absolutely cannot wait for the next book in this series. Grab Besieged, let it take you on a sexy trip to London, and enjoy!   (ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
103	adjudicated	good	"3.5 Stars   I am one of Katy's biggest fans and read everything she writes! I always love her powerful heroes and Aaric Christos is one of her best Alphas! Strong, driven and brilliant, I loved everything about him. .   ""It's never been a game with you.""   Bryn is in desperate need of funding for her start-up company. She has risen from her past tragedies and is determined to make her new business successful. But first she must convince Aaric to lend her the money to get her business off the ground.   Aaric is now very much involved with a wealthy socialite girlfriend but Bryn and Aaric have a past and knew each other years before. I loved the second-chance romance aspect of this story! Along with the New Your City setting, this was a perfectly enjoyable contemporary romance with Katy Evans' trademark brand of HOT sexiness. Will Bryn be able to put aside her personal feelings so that she and Aaric can keep things strictly business?   ""He's the biggest what if I've ever had in my life. The one you always wonder about.""   There's some drama here but it works in the story. I loved Aaric's point of view and feel that it really gave his character depth. He seemed so allofll of at first but then really became someone I was rooting for by the end. The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fast-paced and enjoyable contemporary romance.   I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger; the flashback scenes left me wanting more! If you are a fan of Katy Evans and of second-chance romance, you will love this one!   (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)"
