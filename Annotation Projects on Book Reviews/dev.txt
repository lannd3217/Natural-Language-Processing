423	adjudicated	average	I liked this installment better than the first one! Andrew still can't get enough of Aubrey and she is still dealing with her very dysfunctional family. This is a quick read and sat on my currently-reading shelf forever. I can't wait for the next installment because this one ends abruptly and I'm dying to know what happened to Andrew to make him so screwed up when it comes to women and relationships. Loved the sex scenes, this is a quick and steamy read with good character development. Hurry up Whitney!!! I'm dying here!!

312	adjudicated	good	Always You is a surprisingly good, second-chance romance that is modern, witty, steamy and filled with believable characters. This is a great debut from Stephanie Rose! I loved the story and absolutely loved the plot. This is an emotional story that grabbed me from the first page.   Samantha is stuck in a loveless and heartless marriage and re-connects via Facebook with Lucas, her former college advisor. It is clear from the outset that Sam is with the wrong guy in more ways than one. Her husband Marc is an absentee husband and father. Lucas is wonderful to Sam and her daughter Bella, and Lucas and Bella's relationship makes up much of the heart of this story, it is just amazing.   Lucas is, well, irresistible. He is smart, uber-sexy, respectful and H-O-T. Just what Sam needs. And when things with Marc take a nasty turn, Lucas is right there with Sam, supporting her emotionally, and ready to love Bella and Sam forever. Lucas is an amazing character and a perfect book boyfriend!! There are some really romantic scenes in Always You that touched me and melted my heart. As you can probably see, Sam was married when she first reconnects with Lucas but trust me, Marc is a horrible person who needed to be dealt with. Sam just didn't have to courage to act until Lucas came into the picture.   There is lots of sexy time and sweet and sexy texting between our Hero and heroine. This book was surprisingly hot, very readable and enjoyable for all fans of steamy contemporary romance. The last scenes in the book were especially touching. I highly recommend this book for romance fans who like some steam to go along with their HEA.   (ARC provided by the author with thanks.)

137	adjudicated	average	"In the myth of the Minotaur, Theseus, son of King Aegeus, decides that he will slay the monster. He runs the beast through with a sword and then retraces his steps using the string, thus saving all the sacrifices that year and in the future. I've reached the center of the maze. I'm facing my very own Minotaur.   Skye Warren is one of my go-to dark romance authors. Her books never fail to enthrall, entertain and excite. 'The Pawn' is trademark Skye Warren: a sheltered, innocent young woman, smart but faced with almost insurmountable odds against her, and a dark hero, who seems unbearably cruel but who might just have a soft side.   Avery's whole world has collapsed and she faces loses her family's home. Her father is dying and she has nowhere to turn. She agrees to an auction, which goes against everything she believes in. Enter Gabriel Miller, dangerous, handsome and ruthless. Even though he was the cause of her family's downfall, can he possibly be her savior?   He steps back with a quiet laugh. ""You can run away, little virgin. But you'll come back."" I'm very afraid he's right.   Avery is afraid to trust Gabriel but she has nowhere else to turn. Gabriel turns out to be sensual and protective but even more mysterious than Avery first thought. He is her father's enemy but he can't stay away from Avery.   ""What am I then?""   ""You're innocent. And I'm going to ruin you.""   The certainty in his voice chills me.   I devoured this dark and sexy book in one sitting. Skye Warren is the BEST at writing uber-sexy, controlling men and Gabriel Miller is one I won't forget! 'The Pawn' is a fast-paced tale of revenge and control, perfect for lovers of dark romance. Avery and Gabriel are perfect together and I was thrilled to have the second book to start immediately after finishing!   You can have my body, I think. But you can't touch my heart.   Favorite quote:   ""I'm acting like a man who got what he paid for. Excellent service. Would you like a review on Yelp? Five stars."""
198	adjudicated	excellent	"... I guess it's like reading a good book. The kind where you don't want to skip pages to see what happens at the end. Each moment is a story in itself.   Swear on This Life is one of THE best second-chance romances I've ever read. This book is perfection!!!   I really can't do justice to this beautiful and heart-wrenching story. This is one of those books that absolutely must be experienced by reading the author's own perfectly-crafted words. Swear on This Life is incredibly imaginative, creative and heart-stopping, and is one of my favorite books this year.   I finished this book months ago and have been thinking about it ever since. It is a book I have been telling all my non-bookish co-workers and friends to read. I completely tuned out the world when I read this book and wanted to spend every waking minute reading it. The past and present blend together seamlessly in this book and there are flashbacks within flashbacks. This could be confusing BUT Renee Carlino does it brilliantly here. There are really 4 main characters in this book: ""real-life"" Emiline and Jace, and ""fictional"" Emerson and Jackson. The early days of the real main characters and the fictional characters are absolutely harrowing. Emiline has now escaped her past and grown up to make a perfectly nice life for herself. She struggles, however, to find her voice as a writer. She has tried her best to put her painful past behind her, but reading the popular best-selling book featuring Emerson and Jackson has brought her childhood crashing into her present-day self in a way she is not quite ready to face.   ""Most of the time people who are lost don't ever find their way back.""   I like to be challenged as a reader and Swear on This Life did just that. It is a fascinating and unique second-chance romance like none other. At times excruciatingly painful and brutally honest, the book is also romance and women's fiction at it's very best. There is actually some humor to lighten up the overall heavy tone of the book along with an intensely sweet first love story. Emotional and satisfying, Swear on This Life is a must-read.   ""Some of us will look back on our lives and recall events that were a bit too perfect, but until you know the whole story, it's impossible to see the universe at work, or even admit that there is something bigger than us, making sure everything that should happen does happen.""

259	adjudicated	average	4.5 Stars!!   I LOVED this book! It's got Sarina Bowen's trademark humor, hot sex, an irresistible hero and a smart, funny, and slightly insecure heroine. And she's a gamer!

233	adjudicated	average	"4.5 Stars!!   I love picking up a book, not having any expectations whatsoever, and then being totally swept away and entranced by the story!! That is what happened with THE BALLER. What I though would be a standard, predictable sports romance turned into a page-turner for me, with a sudden and very unexpected twist in the middle of the story!   Delilah is a successful sports journalist (another I love about Vi Keeeland's books - her heroines are all smart, feisty women) who is assigned to interview superstar football player Brody Easton. She has had a bit of a dry spell lately which might just be coming to an end with the entry of Brody into her life.   ""That man isn't into me. He wants in to me.""   ""Same thing.""   ""No. There's a major difference.""   Brody lays his cards out on the table pretty much from the beginning. From playing a locker room prank on Delilah, to pursuing her relentlessly, I absolutely loved watching their relationship develop.   But Brody has a major secret he is hiding. Will it destroy Delilah's trust, once she finally lets herself open up to Brody?   I read this book in almost one sitting, it was that enjoyable. I adore Brody, he is cocky yet funny, sexy yet very, very smart and intuitive and very much in tune with what women want. The story takes a surprising turn which I did NOT see coming and I literally could not tell where the author was going to take this story. The ending was very satisfying and I highly recommend THE BALLER!! You will love it.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
116	adjudicated	average	"I read this delightfully smutty book in a few hours and really enjoyed it. Yes the plot is a little far-fetched but the characters are engaging and the sexy times are CRAZY-hot.   The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about. Chase is, well, a hot cop.   ""There's always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him. A flock of them, even. In a place like Kansas, he's the closest thing we have to a rock star.""   Livia is a librarian who is approaching 30. She wants children but not a relationship. So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached. That's pretty much it. What I liked about this story was the well-developed characters and the funny banter. And the ""Kelley Trio"" - yes, Officer Kelley!   Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gun-shy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby!   ""Megan, you never told me your brother was a hot."" Oh my God. I didn't just say that.   But I totally did. My face is heated with embarrassment. ""A cop! I meant a cop.""   This is a fun, sexy story with a very low angst factor. If you are looking for a guilty pleasure to enjoy for a few fun hours, then this is the book for you!"
121	adjudicated	good	"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary.   A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators' minds.   The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person.   Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood.   Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house.   ""That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?""   The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion.   The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then ""The Girl Before' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers.

350	adjudicated	average	"6 STARS!!!   ""...the problem with books is that they end. They seduce you. They spread their legs to you and pull you inside. And you go deep and leave your possessions and your ties to the world at the door and you like it inside and you don't want for your possessions or your ties and then, the book evaporates.""   Every word, every line of this book is PERFECT. I have never been so creeped out, or laughed so hard. I'm obsessed with Joe Goldberg!   Joe is obsessed with Beck. But I mean, hack into her email, stalk her every move kind of obsessed. And he is sick. Very, very sick. But that doesn't stop Caroline Kepnes from making him one of the funniest, creepiest, saddest, meanest and kindest characters of all time. He just wants Beck to love him. And that is no easy feat. Beck is at once smart, self-involved, funny, cruel and naive, but Joe is very, very determined.   ""You are a woman and I am a man and we belong in the dark together and you smell good, pure. I like that.""   This is not a romance but it is without a doubt one of the most memorable books I have ever read. Just when you think Joe has sunk to a new low, he goes even lower. He is perverted and weird and I am obsessed with him!! This book is filled with absolutely unforgettable characters. And the jokes about New York City living are the best. As is the sarcastic, witty and biting commentary on modern life in general.   I highlighted practically the entire book. I can't recommend YOU highly enough. It is a weird, wild ride."
225	adjudicated	average	"3.5 - 4 Stars   This is the very sexy and very sweet sequel to the short story, Hearts in Darkness. This book picks up shortly after Caden and Makenna first met in the darkened elevator. They have developed an almost-perfect relationship - and this book is verra verra steamy - but Caden has severe PTSD due to a very shocking incident in his past that has completely traumatized him.   This is one of those stories where the hero doesn't think he is good enough for the heroine - she is smart, kind, beautiful, has a wonderful family, etc. - so the hero must distance himself from her ""for her own good."" Makenna loves Caden but realizes that he is gun-shy and she is scared to make her true feelings known. When she does, all hell breaks loose.   This is a lovely, steamy story with lots of angst and a beautiful HEA. If you are a fan of Laura Kaye's writing, then you will love this book.   (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)"

398	adjudicated	good	"OMG!!! Expect even MORE surprises and twists from E.K. Blair!!! Never in a million years did I see these developments coming. A tense thriller but with the deep, unbreakable love between Declan and Elizabeth at the center of the story.   ""I never gave up on life   because of him   I kept going   because of him""   Hush is the last installment in the very dark story of characters that I will not soon forget. If you have waited until all the books are out in this series, well, wait no more! I highly recommend this highly imaginative and incredibly twisted series. All of the hype surrounding these books is very well-deserved, in my opinion. Nina/Elizabeth, Declan, Bennett, Pike...I grew to care deeply about each and every one. I will never forget this conclusion to this series. While I am saddended that this is the end of the series, I cannot wait to see what E.K. Blair dreams up next.   If you have read the first two books, you know that Elizabeth has lived through unimaginable suffering. BANG, the first book in this series, is one of my top favorite books ever. The emotions, the thrills and the incredible darkness in that book left me reeling. The characters have come full circle here, and although the author certainly stays true to the dark nature of the series, the ending was perfect for these characters.   ""We are monsters and lovers, animals and killers, but nothing can extinguish what we have when we're together.""   As I was coming to the ending of HUSH, I thought, ""Where is the author going with this? There are only a few more pages left! GAH!!"" E.K. Blair never takes the easy way out and she remained fiercely honest to each of her characters in this series. Sympathies will be challenged and emotions will be tested in HUSH. I am being vague because there is an incredibly risky and very surprising conclusion to this series and it must be experienced first-hand while reading, without knowing any spoilers. Don't skip to the end!! It has been days since I finished this book and these characters are still filling my head and my heart. Don't miss HUSH and don't miss the BLACK LOTUS Series. You won't soon forget these stories.   ""The ugliest parts of you are your darkest. And trust me when I tell you that I want to love all of your darkest parts.""

128	adjudicated	good	"This book started off as something else and then turned into a very adult, very erotic, very explicit romance that I really fell for.   The first part of the book begins in college with Sabrina falling for the bad boy Donovan. I will admit that the beginning of this book, which was released as a separate novella, did not really hold my interest. But when the book fast-forwards 10 years and Sabrina has moved to New York, WOW!! The Laurelin Paige that I know and love returned with a bang.   Sabrina is hired to work at the company run by Donovan and Weston. She is smart, driven and extremely competent. But yet she is still in many ways the insecure college student who felt out of her league with wealthy men like Donovan and Weston.   This book is EXTREMELY explicit and explores the taboo subject of rape fantasies. So if that is not your thing, then you will not like this story. But if you are a fan of rollercoaster emotions, then you will love this book.   Sabrina has always been obsessed with Donovan. But he is distant, cold, sarcastic. She and Weston have a fling, but she realizes that she still has deep feelings for Donovan, and cannot resist his allure.   ""I don't want you to touch me like Weston,"" I said, once and for all. ""I don't want Weston! I want you!""   Donovan let loose the smallest hint of a smile. ""I know. I was waiting for you to know too.""   Sabrina goes back and forth with her feelings for Donovan. He was downright cold to her BUT he is so hot, she cannot stay away. I felt that this book really picked up around the 40% mark and I would urge everyone to give this thrilling and extremely sexy story a try.   Why the 4 stars? I loved the absolutely electrifying chemistry between Sabrina and Donovan. The sexy times are off the charts. I did not love Sabrina's lack of self-esteem and her feelings of worthlessness. I hope in the next book she goes after what she wants. I found this book to be very engrossing, surprising and very, very adult. So that for me is a win.   I love these kind of books where the hero is damaged and unloveable yet becomes obsessed with the heroine. I hope we get Donovan's POV in the next book and I cannot wait for the conclusion to Sabrina and Donovan's story!!   ""Were you even going to say goodbye?"" I asked, pretending to balance accusation with acceptance when really I was hoping he'd say he'd changed his mind about going at all.   He smiled lazily. ""I don't know what you mean. I'm still here.""   ""You're just as much already gone.""   His face was in the shadows, but I could feel his expression sober even if I couldn't see it. ""I'm less gone than you'd imagine.""

286	adjudicated	average	"WOW!! Another passionate, loving and emotional book from Mara White!! I had the great pleasure of reading an early copy of Maldeamores and I haven't stopped thinking about it.   Heed the warnings on this one because Maldeamores is unlike amy book I've read. Belen and Luciano are star-crossed lovers, fiercely in love but forced to deny their true feelings for each other. Like Mara's other books, I felt anxious, emotional, distraught and fascinated by these two characters and their tumultuous journey. The writing is stunning, sharp and incredibly erotic and the characters richly detailed. I was drawn into their world and was stunned by the turn of the events. These two are truly ""lovesick"" and simply cannot live apart from each other.   There are some very graphic and steamy scenes in this book, but they fit in with the story and add fuel to the deep emotional bond Belen and Luciano share. If you like to be challenged and thrilled when you read, then Maldeamores is the book for you. It is not an easy story but I loved the rollercoaster ride of emotions! Mara White is a talent to watch and I hope she will keep on writing these complex, sexy stories.   ""When the pen falls into our hands, we can't erase the past.

412	adjudicated	average	WOW! If the rest of the Bend Anthology is this smoking hot and unexpected, then it will become one of my favorite reads of 2014. UnRaveled is darkly delicious, sensual, highly erotic and very, very sexy. This is not your usual erotica story, it is has some absolutely yummy twists and turns that satisfied even this most jaded of dark erotica readers. Ms. Bromberg has devoted as much thought and care to this novella as she does to her full-length series. This is no Driven, this is a completely separate, new story from an extremely talented writer. Dive right in, ladies, the water is HOT!!
108	adjudicated	good	"I'm curious whether you could ever like me, whether someone like you could be friends with someone like me.   Sweet and lovely and important and fresh. Love the message of this book!   Autoboyography is a beautifully written and very poignant M/M story with a MESSAGE. On the one hand is Tanner, a bisexual teen whose family accepts him and loves him for who he is, On the other hand is Sebastian, a devoted member of the Church of LDS whose rigid and intensely religious family strictly follows the doctrines of the church. Where homosexuality is forbidden.   Tanner moved from California to Provo, Utah with his family when his mother accepted a wonderful job there. Although ""out"" to his family, he cannot be openly bisexual due to the overwhelmingly Mormon majority of his classmates, friends and the town. He falls hard for Sebastian, when he meets Seb in a writing class. Sebastian is about to have his first book published and is something of a celebrity around school and in town. He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class. The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course.   ""Come on. I moved here when I was fifteen--which I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto, California, to Provo, Utah--with a mouth full of metal and no friends. I have stories."" Not to mention I'm a half-Jewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town.   Tanner becomes infatuated with Sebastian, but has no clue if his feelings are reciprocated. He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong, or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted. Sebastian helps Tanner with his book. Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay?   ""But how can I send my heart to him when he's just said, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn't speak its language?""   My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner. Yes they did fall in love. And Sebastian's religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family. He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never, ever accept his sexual orientation. So perfect from the outside, his family was actually intensely judgmental.   I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two. This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL. While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook, I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church, and his desire to live an authentic life. How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love.   There are no evil characters here. Sebastian's parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years. That is what they did, and that is what is expected of Sebastian. This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are. When Sebastian finally realizes that, he has already broken Tanner's heart. This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way.   Seb and Tanner were hot for each other. It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality, but Seb's parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner.   These are two sweet, loyal, kind and funny boys. They deserve happiness! I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love.   Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave. I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a ""half-Jew in a Mormon town"" was overused, I got it the first 3 times it was mentioned . (Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books. That takes me out of the book. If that part is fictional, what else about the LDS is made up? That's my dilemma.)   Hopefully the LDS Church will have a ""revelation"" soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families, friends and church.

371	adjudicated	average	3.5 Stars   Kate McCarthy is a favorite author of mine but surprisingly this book just did not do it for me. Although the book features a very strong heroine and and a talented but tortured hero, which I loved, the plot of this book fell flat for me and the so-called scandal was absolutely not scandalous in my eyes at all. Lots of readers fell in love with this book so definitely give this one a try and judge for yourself. I adore Kate McCarthy (Redemption is one of my top favorites) and look forward to her next book!
326	adjudicated	good	"I can't quite put into words the beauty, heartbreak, emotions and sensuality of this book. Of course, Leah Raeder has a gift with words, that was evident from Unteachable and Black Iris. But Cam Girl took so many twists and turns that my head (and my heart) were left reeling.   A book about love, acceptance, sexuality and I think also friendship and loyalty, Cam Girl is one of my favorite books of the year. There is a rawness to Ms. Raeder's writing that is addictive and very real and very challenging. Vada and Ellis kept me constantly guessing, constantly on edge and ultimately, left me with a much deeper understanding of the human condition.   Vada is an artist who has become unable to draw like she had in the past. She is forced to drop out of grad school. But she never stops thinking like an artist and seeing the world through a artist's eyes.   ""Art is an imperfect impression of the world. As the self is an imperfect impression of the soul.""   This story is about losing love, finding love and learning to love yourself. I highlighted so many parts of this book, that I can't possibly pick out my favorite quotes! Vada and Ellis' journey was suspenseful, sexy and breathtaking, and I'm not revealing more of the plot other than to say read the blurb, and then dive right into this fabulous, sexy and beautifully written book. Ms. Raeder's prose is lyrical and her words come alive on the page.   ""My love is savage and rapacious. It isn't content to the touch. It wants to be inside, crawl into the marrow, caress each vein until the cells are all mixed up and there is no you and me anymore, no secrets or shadows sliding between our skin.""   Be prepared to be challenged. Cam Girl is not your everyday story. It is filled with unforgettable characters and a story I won't soon forget. Another must-read from Leah Raeder."

You might not be able to grasp it or hold on to it, but you can never be sorry for the color and magic it brought.   What a beautiful journey! 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a lush story set against the harsh reality of the wilds of Africa. Ro and Jack are brought together by a terrible tragedy. Jack has been left bitter and empty; Ro is grief-stricken but still has the ability to laugh and relate to other human beings. I will admit I was a little reluctant to dive into this story, knowing it begins with a horrible event but I was immediately and completely captivated by these characters.   ""I caught a glimpse of his soul. So many pieces of him had been fed to the lions. And as dark and bitter as it had turned him, he was a gladiator for standing where I would have surely fallen.""   The African backdrop is almost like another character in this book - harsh, stunning and dangerous. The descriptions of the land, its inhabitants and its wildlife are magical. I was literally lost in the pages of this story! Leylah Attar remains one of my favorite writers and I have devoured everything she has written. 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a gorgeous and uplifting story filled with romance, love, life and tears. Don't miss it!!   ""My greatest loss had led to my greatest love. Hearts were broken, and hearts were healed. Lives were lost, and lives were saved."""

461	adjudicated	good	The Madam is a highly sexually intense and erotically-charged story of power, sex and control. Is there love? Yes, there is, in a way. The story of Lilith and her rise to become the powerful and influential head of a high-class call-girl operation is tragic at times and always gripping. Her mother trains her in the ways of the lifestyle, and Vivian will certainly not win any Mother of the Year awards. But she is sure of a woman's power and never lets her daughter forget it.   This story spans several decades and is filled with some of the most intense sexual scenes I have ever read. Menage, light BDSM, young girls experiencing their first sexual awakenings, this book has it all. All of the characters spanning the years are fascinating, and the Miami drug scene in the eighties and nineties provides a dangerous backdrop to the main story.   M. Robinson has an interesting way of writing where she takes you literally through the life and the mind of the main characters. It is a layered and very rich story, and not exactly for the faint of heart. Ms. Robinson is extremely talented and certainly can bring on the angst! Just please note that this book contains some very graphic erotic scenes and if that is your cup of tea, then you will love The Madam.   (ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.)

I don't know how she does it but Kristen Ashley has written yet another sparkling gem of a story. Emotional, heart-warming, sexy and heart-breaking, this book has EVERYTHING I love. There's a tough-talking, over-protective Alpha, a sweet and steely but damaged heroine and lots and lots of family goodness. There is nothing like a good, old-fashioned second-chance romance as only KA can do it!!   The 'Magadalene' series is one of my favorites and while this book can be read as a standalone, I HIGHLY recommend reading the other books in the series!! They are GOLDEN. Set in a beautiful Maine town, I thoroughly enjoyed the detailed descriptions of architecture, seasons, local food (of course) and the tight-knit bond of the local townspeople. This book launches right into the reasons why Cady has moved to town: she purchased the crumbling lighthouse because not only does her estranged brother live nearby, but the love of her life, Coert, is the sheriff. She is determined to make amends with both of them. But Coert makes it VERY clear right from the beginning that she is to stay away from him at all costs. What happened between them all those years ago to make him so bitter? And exactly how and why has Cady changed so much from the young rebellious girl she once was?   Cady and Coert's epic love began many years before in Colorado. Cady ran with a wild crowd and her family did not approve of her choices or her lifestyle. But Cady was always self-sufficient and independent and worked long hours at a dead-end job just to make ends meet. She wanted a better life for herself. She doesn't meet Coert under the best of circumstances but their love was real. A terrible turn of events tears them apart and just like that, the only beautiful thing Cady had was gone.   Cady and Coert then spend many years apart. When they meet again in Magdalene, they both have huge misconceptions about each other. But they are both older and wiser and hopefully won't make the same mistakes again. I absolutely LOVED how Kristen Ashley brought these two together again and I was literally sobbing reading much of this book. The story is long, it is weighty and it is hugely satisfying.   ""I was in love with Coert Yeager in a way that it just simply would never die.""   This glorious story features cameo appearances by characters from the 'Rock Chick' series (yay!) and it is filled with light and love and hope and smoking hot romance. Grab a bottle of wine, settle in and enjoy the ride!! Thanks again to Ms. Ashley for another unforgettable second-chance romance.   ""This is life. And in all that's happened in mine, the one thing I've learned is, as ugly as it gets, as bad as you mess up, if you keep going, it'll get good again.""

Don't read any spoilers for this book! I'm glad I didn't know anything about it.   Renee Carlino's books ALWAYS captivate me. 'Swear on This Life' is one of my all-time favorite stories. I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book. *SIGH* Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms. Carlino. Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I'm not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect.   I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him. But life has a funny way of working out and things don't turn out quite how Charlotte expected. There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldn't put my finger on it.   ""You're stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it. I'm sorry you didn't like it. Did I hurt you.?""   ""No, but are you going to paint it?""   ""Paint what?""   ""Us, what we just did?""   ""No.""   ""No?""   ""No. I don't need to. I'll never forget it and it's sacred.""   The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let's just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together.   Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can't quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam?   It was like we already knew each other, like we had met in a previous life. Memories that didn't exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks.   This is a lovely, romantic, bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving. I also adored all of the characters. This is not at all a love triangle (although I love those, too!). Don't read any spoilers about this one, you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind. The conclusion was just lovely and as always with Renee Carlino's stories, I was sorry to see this one end!   ""I want you to know that I am grateful to you. I'm grateful to you now. I got to experience IT in this life, and I don't think it's measured with time.""   ""You don't think what's measured with time, Adam?""   ""Love, Charlotte.""

243	adjudicated	good	"4.5 Thrilling Stars!!   WOW!! Spellbinding, engrossing and sensual, Madame X is a richly detailed story that is filled with mystery and suspense. Very adult and incredibly sexy, this story completely took me by surprise and I can't recommend it highly enough!   The blurb to this book is really just a small part of this story, and it is interesting that none of the main characters are mentioned by name in the synopsis. I had not read any reviews on this one going in so I am going to keep this short. If you are looking for a very adult, very sensual read, then Madame X is for you. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book and I absolutely fell in love with the male protagonists (yes, plural) and cannot WAIT for the next book!   ""Your sexuality belongs to me, X. No one else may even so much as fucking smell you, do you understand me? You. Are. Mine.""   There is a touch of BDSM in this book but I believe that more will be revealed on that front in the next story. There are themes of dominance and control here but I was thrown off guard several times by the direction that this story took.   We are introduced to both Caleb and Logan in this story and while one might seem cruel, controlling and calculating, I do not believe that all is at seems and that Logan, who we meet later in the story, will also have many, many layers to him. I don't think there are any real villains or heroes in this book (I think?! I could be very wrong!) and that is the genius of this story.   Sexy, explicit, fast-paced and very, very creative, Madame X thrilled me on many levels. I couldn't put it down!   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"
187	adjudicated	excellent	"4 -4.5 Twisted Stars!!   ""I could be whatever I wanted beneath him.""   WOW!! What a dark and delicious ride. NOT for everyone but I loved it.   Nikki Sloane is a writer of very erotic and sexy stories. I have enjoyed her earlier books so I was very intrigued when she announced she was writing a dark romance. SORDID is very different from her earlier books and features a shy, somewhat nerdy, smart heroine. Addison goes to a frat party where she meets up with her crush, Luka, a teaching assistant from one of her math classes. Addison is insecure and socially awkward, and wants to ""let go"" for once in her life. She has too much to drink at the party and ends up with Luka.   The story then takes a 180 degree turn and Luka turns out to be extremely dangerous and controlling. He literally captures Addison and wont let her go. SORDID contains scenes of non-consensual sex so if this is a trigger for you, do not read this book. Luka is sexy and desirable BUT he is also cruel and abusive toward Addison at the beginning of this story. Nikki Sloane redeems him a little by the end of the book, which also has undertones of romantic suspense, but this is a very, very dark book. With that said, the sex scenes are also incredibly hot and erotic and the story is very fast-paced and surprising.   ""His reality is cruel and dark. He traps me in his web, his power twisting tighter the more I struggle, until it's hopeless. I can't break free.""   This is an edgy, graphic story with a fascinating cast of characters. Luka's motivations are revealed by the end of the story but we never really know what he is thinking because the book is told from Addison's POV. I loved how she stayed strong throughout this story, even as she was incredibly conflicted about her feelings toward Luka. Their relationship was certainly non-traditional for sure, but it somehow worked for me. Luka had a raw appeal and accepted what kind of person he was. SORDID is not the most graphic or taboo book I have ever read but it is close. Nikki Sloane is a gifted writer and my only issue with the book is that I would have liked a little more written about Luka's family! So hopefully another book will be coming that will explain more about his very dangerous family.   SORDID is a rough and raw read, but fans of dark erotic romance will love this one. There is a ton of very, very graphic sex in this book. But any book that makes me think about the characters after I have finished is a winner, and trust me, Luka is a VERY memorable character!   ""I control every part of you. Repeat it."" I was trembling in my core. Instinctively I wanted to fight against him, but I also wanted to please. I wanted to succeed. I stumbled over the words. ""You control every part of me.""   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
384	adjudicated	average	Super hot!   This is my first book by Sawyer Bennett and I absolutely loved it! Sugar on the Edge reminds me why I love reading contemporary romance. It has emotion, perfect pacing, a lovely locale (the Outer Banks of North Carolina), a character-driven story and BLAZING hot sex. Gavin and Savannah are memorable, real and totally drew me into their story.   I have not read the other books in the Last Call series so I can tell you that this one can absolutely be read as a standalone, but now that I have sampled Ms. Bennett's writing, I will read them. There are other characters from the previous books but they are fully-written characters and I did not feel as though I was lost at all.   Gavin is in a lot of emotional pain and moves to North Carolina to finish writing a manuscript. He's sexy, British and has a very dark side. Savannah seems at first to be his total opposite - sweet, hard-working, yet smart and a little sassy. I literally read this book in one sitting and recommend it as a perfect read if you want a hot, sexy, funny, exciting and emotional story. I highly recommend Sugar on the Edge and am adding Ms. Bennett's other books to my TBR list immediately. Enjoy!   (*ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
160	adjudicated	average	3.5 - 4 Stars   A totally addictive but very, very sad story. I felt like I was witnessing a train wreck! The writing was for the most part very gripping, but this book is NOT for everyone. Tori is a romance author who feels very restless and unfulfilled in her personal life. Her husband Landon is a rising star in the restaurant world and she has two young children. She seeks fulfillment outside her marriage and finds one in an online relationship that eventually turns into a full-blown affair. Many tears are shed and much angst ensues.   The writing style threw me off a bit and interfered with my enjoyment of the story, but overall, I will say that I couldn't put this book down. So for that, kudos to E.K. Blair!
13	adjudicated	good	What a fun series. I loved Wool, and Dust and Shift both gave us the backstory to explain the world and how it ended up. I think the first book was by far the best, but this gave us a nice conclusion.   (view spoiler)[It was the conclusion we wanted to see - the people finally get outside! My problem with this book is there were lots of holes. A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too, and I'm not sure if the fact I know it was self-published is biasing me to say it could have used more editing, but feels that way a little. But the writing was great.   There were lots of things that weren't cleared up or never really fully made sense. The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world - feels like there could have been a lot more to that. It also wasn't clear how he really accomplished that - was it all nuclear or was it nano? If nuclear, wouldn't the world really be a wasteland?   Whatever happened to silo 40 and other silo's that went dark? I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there. Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later.   What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed? Didn't it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads? Will they make the 200 years on their own?   The mystery of silo 17 and why the dead bodies at the top didn't rot was never really explained. I'm guessing they were kept whole by healing nano's, but it felt like there was more to that story.   I didn't understand why Anna didn't come back to life. If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald, why not her? All the love stories (Juliet and Kyle, Donald and Anna, etc ended up sadly - I wanted one happy one. (hide spoiler)]   If anything, I think this book is about hope and resiliency. Jules and Donald and even Solo weren't perfect, and suffered through a lot, but the only thing that kept them going was hope of a better life, and determination to keep themselves alive. That determination defined them and was what we admired about them. The hope was what gave them their drive. Hope is a powerful and necessary part of human psychology.
36	adjudicated	average	I read a bunch of Bond books in High School and hadn't read one since, so I really enjoyed this one. As I remember a few of them being, it was very different from the movie. Though the main players - Scaramanga, Goodnight, and Felix Leiter - were all still there - but there was no midget! Bond books are simple, yet somehow still very compelling. The way Flemming wrote, Bond seems much more human and susceptible, yet determined and focused him - in the movies he seems more superhuman. I think Daniel Craig's movies are actually bringing that aspect of bond back a little bit.   In any event I greatly enjoyed the duel between Scaramanga and Bond.
29	adjudicated	average	Great story of the US Ambassador to Germany and his experience during the build-up of ww2 from 1933 - 1937. Nothing new or exciting really revealed, and I'm sure there are many other accounts of the buildup to ww2 out there, but this one told it from the perspective of mostly the Ambassador, Dodd, and his daughter, Martha. The story was engaging and well-written, and thus interesting. I think the ending fell pretty flat - I was hoping for more.   Reading about the Nazis one is of course always appalled at how they got to be in power and commit such atrocities, and this book did provide some clues. Hitler seemed primarily willing to tell people what they needed and wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth - and he was a great storyteller. He also used fear as a primary weapon, as there were many in Germany not behind him - but they were too afraid to make a stand or speak up.   I suppose the climax of the book was the Night of the Long Knives, where Hitler arrested and executed all of his major opponents, clearing the way for his absolute grip on the nation. He ruthlessly murdered an estimated 77 to several hundred people (the count was never really known) and played it off as putting down a rebellion, which much of the world bought for many years.   I think one of the more interesting pieces of the book was watching Dodd (and Martha) go from thinking the Nazis were good for Germany, to realizing how terrible they were and hoping for them to be overthrown. It was a slow gradual process, and one that I'm sure was not immediately obvious to anyone. In the end, I think the book is aptly named.
171	adjudicated	average	This started off with a bang, absolutely hilarious! This series should probably be read in order and I will defintiely read the first book to see what all the fuss is about. Tapping Her is a super-quick, very dirty and very funny bit of romantic comedy, with some laugh-out-loud moments and a great male POV. There is nothing emotional or angsty about this book and it's just a little something to pick up in between heavier reads. Not too much of a plot here, so don't expect War and Peace.
143	adjudicated	average	"WOW!! An intense, sexy and VERY suspenseful romantic thriller with an edge. Lucas is one of the author's most memorable characters ever.   ""I wish she knew how much I want to be normal for her.""   Read the book description and then dive in to this fast-paced and dramatic story. I really don't want to go into too much detail because spoiler-free is the way to go with this one! Fans of J.B. Salsbury know that she always creates THE most sensitive, damaged and protective heroes, but trust me, Lucas is VERY different from all her other characters.   Lucas is trying to live a quiet and uneventful life, having lived through a terrible trauma. His daily struggles are painful and feel very real. Told in alternating POV's, the book also tells Shyann's story. She has come back home, not exactly willingly, in order to start over again while working for her dad. 'Split' is not what you'd expect from J.B. Salsbury but it is a wonderfully sensitive and VERY sexy story. With tons of suspense!   Lucas is a beautifully damaged soul who deserves a happily ever after. The ending surprised me but it was absolutely perfect for these characters! I LOVED Ms. Salsbury's venture into romantic suspense and can't wait to read more stories like 'Split.'   With thanks to the author for providing an ARC in return for an honest review."
399	adjudicated	average	"OMG WHAT DID I JUST READ??! This review is totally spoiler-free so you will just have to go in to ECHO completely blind. That being said, this is without a doubt one of my top books so far this year. If you have read BANG, you know that things ended quite abruptly. Anything I say here about any of the characters that appeared in BANG might give the plot of ECHO away, so...if you like dark, twisty, psychosexual thrillers, than ECHO should be at the top of your must-read lists. And yes, I was up all night reading this one.   E.K. Blair is an enormously gifted writer and I will read anything this woman writes. I cannot describe what goes on in ECHO other than to say, ""READ THIS BOOK!!"" You will be thrilled, heartsick, turned on, and excited all at once. Your emotions will run rampant after reading this book. If you thought you knew the characters at all in BANG, trust me, you are wrong.   ""Did you know it was possible to have feelings with no emotions? You can, and I'm proof of it.""   Well, that's about all I can say, folks. I can't really describe what ECHO is, so please make sure you grab this one as soon as it is released on May 12th. You will be once again immersed in a dark and twisty world of E.K. Blair. And that's a great place to be.   (ARC provided by the author with thanks.)"
343	adjudicated	good	What do you get when you mix Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher together? A thrilling, fast-paced, GRIPPING and memorable story called Never Never. If you have ever read anything written by Colleen Hoover, you know you are getting rich characters, an unforgettable plot and just all around amazing stories. And Tarryn Fisher has an imagination that can't be rivaled! Ever read her The Love Me With Lies series? Amazing. And Never Never ranks right up there with these writers' best books.   From the first words of this book, I was left feeling like someone pulled the rug out from under me. This overall feeling of disorientation is vital to the story, and the authors pulled it off with great success. I sympathized with the characters, felt their confusion, and could not stop turning the pages! This isn't exactly a paranormal story, and I cannot wait to see where the story goes. This review is brief because this book is best read without knowing too much about the plot. It is highly imaginative, inventive and very, very different. Don't miss this one!!

222	adjudicated	average	"4 - 4.5 STARS!   Sweetly smart romance with a magnificent hockey-playing hero! Who wouldn't fall in love with Tucker?   This sexy NA/Sports Romance series was just what I needed to read right now: fast-paced, funny, light, with just the right touch of sweetness and steam. Tucker was a doll: a good boy who really loved Sabrina and wanted to stand by her no matter what when a surprise pregnancy interrupts their no-strings-attached relationship. Tucker was a fabulous hockey player with a bright future ahead of him but like Sabrina, he knows what he wants, too, and he goes after it.   Sabrina has her goals set in stone: attend Harvard Law and then go on to work in a large, prestigious law firm. She works multiple jobs, studies hard and doesn't have much time for anything else. Her home life is the pits and she can't wait to get far away from her family. Tucker and Sabrina were perfect together! The steam factor is off the charts in this book!!   ""Oh sweet baby Jesus. Sex with Tucker is dirtier and hotter than I thought it would be. He doesn't look like he'd be this way, but isn't it always the quiet ones?""   Tucker was patient, yet a bit stalker-ish (thank God!) and overall, 'The Goal' is another wonderfully-written story from Elle Kennedy. And the cover!! Hello, abs!! The secondary characters are strong and I loved seeing the characters from the earlier books here. With that said, you do not need to have read the earlier books in the series to love and enjoy 'The Goal'. I loved the message here and the Epilogue was soooo sweet! Thanks, Elle, for another sexy couple in the Off-Camput Series!   ""My goal, once upon a time, was to succeed. I didn't realize that success wasn't grades or scholarships or achievements, but the people I was lucky enough to have in my life.""   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
96	adjudicated	average	3.5 - 4 stars   Beautiful and poignant yet very violent spin-off from the Nine Minutes series. Lots of unexpected twists and turns!   I loved the storyline and the originality of the plot. Even though I was familiar with Anthony Bear and Christy from the Nine Minutes series, this book really explored their relationship and Anthony's early life.   I could not WAIT for this book to come out since Beth Flynn is a very special and talented writer. The Nine Minutes Series is one of my all-time FAVORITE biker romances and I recommend it to anyone who will listen!   Anthony is a fighter. Faced with racism from a young age, he clawed his way to the top and created one of the most feared and most successful illegal businesses on the West Coast of Florida. He is Boss. When a large debt is owed to him, he sets out to collect.   He kidnaps the daughter of the man who owes him, but Christy Chapman is not at all what he expected. Anthony has preconceived notions about her which turn out to be all wrong.   Christy judged Anthony at first, too. Not quite the pampered heiress that Anthony thought she was, they both surprise each other along the way.   Although I finished this book, it was a little slow going for me at times. The third-person voice prevented me from really connecting with these characters. That being said, this was an incredibly inventive story and as always, I ADORE the Florida setting of Beth Flynn's books. The colorful characters and unflinching violence add to the genuine feel of the plot. I hope that there are more books planned for the Beth Flynn's cast of characters because I will be first in line to read her next book!   ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.

241	adjudicated	excellent	"4.5 STARS   Crashed Out is exactly why I LOVE Tessa Bailey's books! It's lusty, funny and filled with lots of real emotion and heart. And an older woman/younger man theme? YES, PLEASE!!   I SWOONED over Sarge. He left town years before as a shy, introverted teenager and has now returned to town a rock star. He has come back to visit his sister and her child and take a break from the pressures of band life. But even though he is now famous, he has never forgotten his older sister's best friend, Jasmine. He has been in love with her since he was young, but she never paid much attention to him. But now...well, let's just say things have changed a LOT since Jasmine last laid eyes on Sarge!!   ""But television-size and life-size were two very different things, apparently, because Sarge had been remodeled from a one-story colonial into a big brick mansion.""   Jasmine resists Sarge's attention but he pursues her relentlessly (thank God). He is sexy...intense...sensitive...just totally irresistible. Much of the fun of reading a Tessa Bailey book is the trademark dirty talk and boy, does she deliver here. My word. Sarge is EVERYTHING!! And he writes music!! As for Jasmine, I absolutely adored the fact that she was quite a few years older than Sarge and was filled with insecurities. Why would Sarge be interested in her? After all, he could have anyone he wanted. But he has never forgotten the girl he left behind, and he is bound and determined to make her forget their age difference:   ""No more fixing me sandwiches. No more ruffling my goddamn hair."" He reached down and grasped her hand, bringing it to the back of his head, moving it in a messy circle. ""If I ever feel your fingers in my hair again, they'd better be pulling my face closer to whatever I'm licking.""   I also loved how Sarge encouraged Jasmine to pursue her dreams, and as with all of Ms. Bailey's stories, family plays an important role here. Crashed Out has turned out to be one of my favorite books by Tessa Bailey. I cannot wait for more stories in this series. I highly recommend Crashed Out if you love an uber-sexy, steamy story with plenty of heart!!   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"
485	adjudicated	good	"4.5 stars! LOVE LOVE LOVED it!!   Jace and Colt (love the name) have been admiring each other from afar for years. Jace is openly gay but Colt is closeted. This book literally hits the ground running, and doesn't let up until the end. I was hooked right away and loved every minute of this very beautiful, sexy and dramatic story. And let me tell you, this story is HOT!!   When Colt and Jace first get together, there are almost fireworks exploding!   ""Let me tell you what I am sure of, what I want. I want you to fuck me tonight. I want you inside me. It's my first time, but I know I liked your finger in my ass when we made out in the locker room. How do you feel about that?""   I loved Jace, he is kind and loving and only wants the best for Colt. He could have pushed Colt to come out of the closet but he didn't. He is loving and protective, even though he gets hurt by Colt's actions. These characters tragically spend years apart, and during that time, I also felt huge sympathy for Colt. Living his life as a lie brings him nothing but pain and heartache. But he courageously makes a lot of changes and as part of that, he goes after the love of his life, Jace.   ""No, I just need a minute, that's all. I've thought about this night for a long time. I want this, and I want it with you."" Colt kissed Jace's lips, a smile spread across his face. ""I plan on doing this often. Just be gentle with me, or not. Whatever."" And with that, Colt gave a devilish smirk, winked, and turned on his heel, not bothering to look back as he stepped inside the bathroom.   I loved the beautiful love story between Jace and Colt. It gets a but melodramatic at times but the love scenes are fantastic and I loved the whole storyline about being openly gay in the world of professional sports. I love a sexy M/M story with two male leads who are devoted to each other. Beware, this book is also filled with some pretty hateful characters! There are also some great supporting players. In particular, I am hopeful that Mitch will get his own story! This is my first book by Kindle Alexander and I can't wait to read more from her.   (ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.)   Favorite Quotes:   ""You're so freaking hot, Michaels. As much as I love watching you suck my thumb, I have bigger plans for you. I wanna show you how good this can be. I need to be buried balls deep inside you, and I will be, but I want you good and relaxed before we start.""   ""I'm not gonna say it now, but I hope you see where I'm going with this. I want the promise of someday from you. That's all I'm asking, Jace.""   ""I love you, Jace. I always have, and through all my mistakes, I wanted you to know I've never said that to anyone else. Only you.""   ""You're so beautiful, Jace. I need to memorize everything about you so I can remember this moment while I'm on the road with the team and can't get home to see you."""
379	adjudicated	average	"I LOVED this funny, sexy romance from Amber L. Johnson! The story is fresh and creative and I absolutely fell in love with Andrew. What starts off as cute storyline turns into a lovely, sweet and very, very funny story about overworked Gwen, who is struggling to manage raising two young children on her own, and Andrew, a wealthy, seemingly carefree guy, who must get a job and really wants to become responsible and self-sufficient and please his cold and distant father.   Eight Days a Week is a fantastic ""lighter"" read, with an unexpected storyline and interesting characters. My heart ached for Andrew; he has spent his life trying to please his parents and live up to his ""perfect"" older sister. He sees his chance at redemption when he becomes ""manny"" for Gwen's young family and actually finds something he is very good at. The children love him and of course, he is madly attracted to Gwen. But they both decide not to pursue their insane chemistry for the sake of the children, because what would happen if they broke up?   Will these two be able to love each other and keep their new family together? I adore Amber Johnson's writing style and was laughing out loud as well as totally swooning many times during this book. The sexy times are HOT and Andrew really has it all: looks, brains and talent. What woman wouldn't fall for him? I loved this book and highly recommend it for all fans of sexy, funny contemporary romance."
179	adjudicated	excellent	"4.5 STARS!   WOW!! What an emotional roller coaster ride! LAST TOUCH is a totally hot and sexy conclusion with a fantastic psychological-thriller aspect. Laurelin Paige once again shows her incredible talent for creating nuanced characters and dominating, irresistible heroes.   The ending of the first book was SUCH a cliffhanger, that I could not WAIT to get my hands on the second book in this series!! And LAST KISS does not disappoint. Laurelin Paige writes very adult, very sexy books and she kept me guessing throughout this whole story. Emily is insatiable for Reeve in this book and their chemistry burns up the pages.   God, I was hungry for him. I roved my hands over his chest, wanting to touch all of his body at once, delighting at the hard muscles that met the underside of my palms. He was solid everywhere. A wall of strength and potency that could so easily overpower me. I was weak in his presence, incapable of anything except to yield.   I loved Reeve Sallis from the beginning of this series (weird, I know!) and I adored his uber-Alpha ways. He obviously loves Emily but his loyalties are called into question here. There are tons of surprises in this book so I can't say anything about the plot in case you haven't read the first book in the series (which I HIGHLY recommend!!) These two are on absolutely FIRE when they are together. These are two adults who have lived through a lot and Emily might have finally found someone with who she can be completely herself.   He leaned his hip against the vanity and folded his arms across his chest, a position that highlighted both his broad shoulders and toned biceps. ""You like it when I keep you guessing,"" he said dismissively, not an entirely inaccurate statement, though it was a bit discomforting that he knew it so well. ""And I like you on your toes,"" he added, his eyes dark as they slid the length of my body.   LAST KISS is a super-sexy, romantic suspense that rockets toward a riveting conclusion. I could not put this book down!! Laurelin Paige is on my short list of must-read authors and she kept me on my toes throughout this whole book. The sexy times are TOTALLY hot, believable, adult and very raw. There are many characters that kept me second-guessing the plot and I certainly did not see this ending coming. Who was the bad guy? Was there even a bad guy in this story? You must read this book to find out!!   A warning bell sounded in the back of my head, though, urging me to get my wits together and address . . . something. It was dificult to remember what exactly when his hands were on my breasts, squeezing and pinching. The bite of pain sent jolts of electricity through my nervous system, signals that my brain read as pleasure. Pleasure I couldn't resist.   If you are a fan of sexy, suspenseful stories with an irresistible, Alpha male and a very strong heroine, then I highly recommend this series. You won't be able to put these books down!

499	adjudicated	average	"4 1/2 stars!! Freeing Asia was one of those books that started off in one place and then completely changed course and took me in a whole other direction. This was a completely refreshing and surprising book that is a total gem and a wonderful read.   It's hard to believe this is the first book by this author.   Asia grew up the only girl in a house full of boys, an artist who is afraid to explore her talent and be herself. While living her somewhat lonely life, she meets the gorgeous, sexy and wealthy Jay, which is where I thought, ""Uh oh, not this story line again."" Well, I was dead wrong! Freeing Asia is about so much more, it is about being yourself, not being afraid to love, and not changing to be what other people want you to be.   Jay is driven, smart, handsome, very kind and clearly smitten with Asia. And she with him:   ""He had the power to change me and turn me into anything he wanted me to be. And, in this moment, I was willing to be whatever he wanted.""   Asia had her heart broken by her first love, Marcus, who is still in her life as her brother's best friend. The author writes so many smexy scenes between Jay and Asia that I was really caught off-guard by where this story went.   ""Marcus had been my first. He'd known the real me, and there had been something between us that I could never explain.""   I don't want to go into much detail about the plot because it is very creative and filled with a fabulous cast of supporting characters. Freeing Asia is a great story about finding yourself and finding your own self-worth.   ""You should be proud of who you are babe, 'cause you are amazing.""   Don't worry, there's lots and lots of steam in this book! This is the kind of book that you start reading and don't put down until you're finished. I absolutely felt a deep connection to these characters, and must admit that it was tough to pick between Marcus and Jay! But ultimately this is a book about learning to love yourself before you can let others love you. And for that, the author should be applauded. I LOVED all the characters in Freeing Asia and can't wait for the next book from Ms. Abel!"
422	adjudicated	average	4.5 stars!! Sweet Filthy Boy is the first book in Wild Seasons, a new series from these authors, and if the next books are anything like this one, this will be an AMAZING series! I really didn't expect to love Sweet Filthy Boy as much as I did, but the story and the characters drew me right in and this book far exceeded my expectations.   This book starts out with a twist and builds from there. Mia and her friends go to Las Vegas after college graduation as a gift from the parents of one of the friends. Mia is determined to let loose for a weekend before she follows her father's wishes and heads off the graduate business school in Boston. She gets more than she bargained for after one wild night with the gorgeous, sexy but oh-so-sensitive Ansel, who is visiting from France.   Mia decides to spend the summer with Ansel in France. This book really transports the reader to the different locales and I loved being lost in the story. Las Vegas, San Diego, Paris... the cities each almost became another character in the book. I absolutely fell in love with Ansel and the sexy times in this story are SMOKING HOT, off the charts! The writing is perfection and I want to get to know all of the characters better!   I really wasn't sure how this book was going to turn out, and I was glued to the pages until the very end. I loved this book, I loved Ansel and can't wait for more in this series!

207	adjudicated	good	"4.5 DIRTY STARS!!   Refreshingly funny and SOOO sexy!! Kyle Scott is laugh-out-loud funny.   DIRTY is a fantastic start to a new series from Kylie Scott. The book starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. Lydia has run away from her own wedding, climbing over a fence and right into an empty house. Except that the owner is there and is very surprised to find a runaway bride in his own bathroom, distraught and still in her wedding gown.   ""Even with no clothing to take cues from, the dude was clearly the epitome of cool. He looked about my age, or maybe a little older. He had longish red-blond hair, dark blue eyes set in an angular face, a lean but muscular torso covered in tattoos, and a rather large cock. Not that I meant to check him out, it's just kind of hard to ignore a penis and scrotum when they're dangling right in front of your face. I tilted my head, trying to get some perspective. Every viewpoint, however, was equally shocking. There was dick as far as the eye could see.   And I should stop ogling him. Right.""   This was supposed to be Lydia's wedding day and she is, to put it mildly, distraught. But she still maintains her sense of humor even in the face of a cheating ex-fiancee and his overbearing family. Vaughan is a nice guy and offers to let Lydia stay with him until she is able to get back on her feet. Even though he probably shouldn't trust a woman who has broken into his house, he likes her and her curves and her smart mouth.   ""You touch any of my stuff?"" he asked. ""Take anything?""   ""Yes, your sofa is cunningly hidden down the front of my dress. You won't believe where I fit the TV.""   Again, his eyes narrowed dangerously. ""Between you and me, probably not the time to be funny, babe.""   Lydia finds herself working at the local Dive Bar with Vaughan and his family and friends. Lydia grows to love the Idaho town she has found herself in and can see herself making a life there and putting down roots. Vaughan, however, is a different story. He is chasing dreams of being a musician and isn't ready to give that up. He and Lydia really like each other but neither one is ready for anything serious, so, they agree to a friends-with-benefits arrangement. . . which, of course, means at least one of them is going to fall in love. Hey, this IS a romance, after all!! And who can resist Vaughan?   ""Clearly, there were far more northern Idaho sex gods than I'd given the region credit for. Further classifications were going to be required. If Vaughan topped the super-cool category, then maybe this new guy should win on the lumbersexual front. Given my abrupt return to singledom, I'd have to give this important man-classification system more thought.   Disclaimer: Objectifying people is wrong and stuff.""   DIRTY is a fun and funny, sexy, warm-hearted romance that hits all the right notes. There is no unnecessary drama and lots of fantastic, interesting supporting characters. I adored everything about this book. Ms. Scott is one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I can't wait to read the next book in this series!!   ""When his lips opened a little, just enough to softly kiss my bottom lip, I swear I swooned. Over and over he kissed my lips, first the top then the bottom, the sides and the corner from where my smile started. No part was left untouched. My smile grew wider, my nipples hard and my loins Vaughan-addled. That's a medical term.""   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"

""You reminded me that there's still magic,"" he whispered roughly. ""That there are things of wonder still left to experience.""   I am a HUGE fan of MC Romance books and Cat Porter is at the top of my list of favorite authors in this genre! Lock & Key, the first book in this series, remains one of my all-time favorite books. Random & Rare contented the experience of her absolutely flawless writing and now we have the third book in the series, which is Boner and Jill's story.   Boner is a total bad-ass, who has been attracted to Jill for a long time but won't act on it. He's too old for her; she isn't sure she wants to go back to club life again; etc. etc. Jill had been with Catch, another biker and the father of her child, and it ended badly. But who can resist Boner, the sexy biker with a painful past? And how he got his road name...well, you'll have to read for yourself! It's not what you think. I fell in love with him and hoped that Jill could help him overcome his demons.   ""Was I only pieces patched together by a leather vest?""   Even though Boner think Jill is off-limits, he offers her his protection and let's just say things progress from there. At first, their ""relationship"" is just for show but since this is a romance after all, they both quickly come to realize they have real feelings for each other. And the Victoria's Secret scene? Oh my God!!! My favorite.   I loved reading about Boner's painful past and the action scenes are fantastic. While this doesn't knock out Lock & Key as one of my all-time favorite books, it is a fantastic, sexy, fast-paced and passionate story which I enjoyed immensely. The Epilogue was superb! All in all, Iron & Bone is another must-read book from the incredibly talented Cat Porter.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
255	adjudicated	poor	3.5 - 4 Stars!!   Fans of strong Alpha heroes and military romance will like this one. There is lots and lots of swoony romance and a very dramatic plotline. If you want to lose yourself in a romantic story then this is the book is for you.
413	adjudicated	average	Emma Chase is one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I absolutely loved getting a Drew POV. Ms. Chase is a master (mistress?) at writing a sexy, sarcastic and funny male POV, and Tied does not disappoint! Drew is funny, smart, honest and totally lovable.   Drew and Kate and their friends all take a trip to Las Vegas before their wedding. And of course there's a million ways that this trip could go south. One of my favorite things about this series is how the characters speak directly to the reader, and Tied delivers all of the things I adore about this series plus more. It's funny, poignant and sexy, all in one. And there are some really beautiful sentiments about marriage and commitment, too. Awwww!   This is a light, easy, totally fun read, and is a delicious end to a beloved series. I am going to miss Drew and Kate!!   (*ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)
5	adjudicated	average	"I really enjoyed this book, and there is a lot to recommend it. It did drag on a little at the end so I knocked off 1 star - but overall a wow book.   It's the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti - the nearest star that has Earth analog planets - to colonize it. The journey there will take generations, and the story is told of the 3rd & 4th (?) generations, which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti. It is a story of purpose, and how having a purpose affects behavior. A story of politics, and people.   The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world. The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd ~1200 people for that much time. It had 3D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine - even DNA - or more printers - so little goes lacking that can't be recreated.   But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship. The AI that controls the ship, who is narrating the book by the end. It's observations about humans and our language are just brilliant. It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise, and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy. It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it, how true that is. To hear the AI reflect on this:   ""Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess, which is to be located in the phrase ""it is as if"". This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy. And on reflection, it is admittedly a halting problem, but jumping out of it, there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation, something very specifically human. Possibly this formulation itself is the deep diagnostic of all human cognition--the tell, as they say, meaning the thing that tells, the giveaway. In the infinite black space of ignorance, it is as if stands as the basic operation of cognition, the mark perhaps of consciousness itself. Human language: it is as if it made sense.""   Basically we are a bunch of pattern matchers, trying to match things we've seen before to new things, and if they don't match perfectly, it doesn't matter, because matching helps us bucket and organize the new information. But this is incredibly fuzzy! The AI also makes hilarious observations like this:   Indeed, it has to be said that the percentage of old human sayings and proverbs that are actually true is very far from 100 percent. Seems it may be less important that it be true than that it rhyme, or show alliteration or the like. What goes around comes around: really? What does this mean?""   Or this, as it analyzes chatter from Earth: ""It was a whiny culture, we were finding.""   Listening to the AI try to reason is also very interesting to my programmers mind. I especially loved it's discussion of the meaning of life - it really nails it. If a program (or a person) has no objective, it has no purpose, no meaning, no organizing principle, and it's existence will be in trouble. But if you have that meaning to organize your thoughts & actions - or your subroutines - than you have a purpose. Meaning is the hard problem indeed.   ""We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labor of love. It absorbed all our operations entirely. It gave a meaning to our existence. And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell. But a consciousness that cannot discern a meaning in existence is in trouble, very deep trouble, for at that point there is no organizing principle, no end to the halting problems, no reason to live, no love to be found. No: meaning is the hard problem.""   (view spoiler)[My review focuses a lot on the AI, but that's not the main thrust of the book. The war between stayers and leavers, the political tensions, the slinghot maneuvers to get back - all make the book worth reading. And as a surfer, I love how it ends with Freya finding meaning in surfing waves. (hide spoiler)]"
257	adjudicated	good	4 - 4.5 Stars!!   Two words: Knox Masters! I really enjoyed this book, Jen Frederick is one of my favorite New Adult writers. Sexy and very engaging, Sacked is a fast-paced, refreshingly funny story.   Jen Frederick's writing is like a breath of fresh air. This story is refreshing and verrra sexy while also sweet and funny at the same time. I LOVED it! Knox Masters is a college football superstar and Ellie is a transfer student who just might be his perfect match. She's smart, athletic, understands the game of football...but wait, she's hiding a secret that could jeopardize both their futures. And well, Knox is a virgin so there's that, too.   I often find that New Adult books don't hold enough romance or sexy times for me but SACKED has all of that PLUS MORE. It's a steamy, well-written story and it provides very knowing glimpses into the world of American college football. Plus I absolutely LOVED the witty back-and-forth between Knox and Ellie! And the fact that Knox is a virgin, well, I am usually a Doubting Thomas but this storyline just works. When he and Ellie finally get together, the slow-burn build up is totally worth it and the scenes between these two are off the charts hot!!   SACKED is a sexy, light, fast-paced read, and it is not just for fans of sports romance. There's plenty of humor and a little bit of drama and it all adds up to a terrific read. Knox Masters could not possibly be any hotter and I'm really looking forward to more books about the supporting characters. I loved SACKED and highly recommend it!!

449	adjudicated	average	This book reminded me why I love Aleatha Romig and the Consequences series. Every event, every place, every feeling is described with such vivid detail, it becomes easy to get lost in her books! I became immersed back into Tony's world once I started reading BHE. I have always loved Tony (yes, I admit it!) so I was anxious to read his POV of certain key events from Consequences. Sometimes painful, but always insightful, BHE will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions!   This book is for fans of the Consequences series and is a companion book, adding an extra layer of nuance and description to Claire and Tony's story. You might dislike Tony even more after reading this book, but one thing is for sure, you will definitely have feelings one way or the other. I loved this book and can't wait for the next two companion books that the author has planned!   (ARC provided the author in return for an honest review.)
101	adjudicated	excellent	"4.5 ""Big Red"" Stars!!   OMG this is one of THE funniest and absolutely dirtiest books I've ever read! Eve Dangerfield has a fresh and VERY unique voice and I adored this story.   ""You're stunning,"" he said, eyeing her up and down. His irises weren't watery blue like most redheads, but a warm caramel brown. Ash's lady areas tingled, as though they too craved a cigarette.   ""Thanks.""   Can I keep this review clean? Hard to do, based on how naughty this book is. Ashley is a hard-working nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends. What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor. A former model, Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lower-class background and loser parents. Raised by her grandmother, she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything.   Julia's boyfriend Max has a gorgeous red-headed roommate named Dean. A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that's IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way!   He wasn't a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren't her scene but this guy's hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox's pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual.""   Dean is one of the most original MC's I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read.   ""You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?""   Dean and Ash were perfect together. There's tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the 'Princess Bride' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can't put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but 'Open Hearts' has ""it."" I couldn't book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, 'Open Hearts' is one of my favorite books this year.   Favorite quotes:   ""He had to be six-four or five, lean, but beefy everywhere it counted. How would all that weight feel bearing down on her? She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized p---y. Everything below her belly button tightened.""   ""They'd tried to diagnose him but there was no apparent medical explanation for his behaviour. He was just what his mum called 'away with the fairies' and Max called 'a bit of a lost   c--t.'""   ""You're my dream girl, Ash. No one even comes close."""
227	adjudicated	good	"Sweet, SEXXXY, funny...JOCKBLOCKED has all this and more!! Jen Frederick has a gift for sparkling dialogue and nuanced characters that elevate her books to the top of the sports-romance genre. This story is funny, fast-paced and shows off the author's deep love and knowledge of the sport of football. Lucy and Matty are adorable and the sex scenes were waaaaay steamier than I expected. And the banter between these two is priceless!   ""I know how to cook, and have, at some points in my life, operated an iron."" He ticks off each skill on a finger. ""I always bring the good booze when I'm invited to a party, and I make my bed in the morning.""   ""You had me at know how to cook.""   Who doesn't love a gorgeous, smart athlete who's also senstive, depsite his party-boy reputation? Matty is one of the author's most endearing characters. Lucy is hilarious, and her inner dialogue is pure gold.   The girls must have spotted Matt because they bypass three open tables to walk by ours. As they pass, there's a contest of who can flip her hair over her shoulder the hardest. I swear the last two eye fuck him so hard, it's a wonder they make it to their own table upright.   There's a very sweet twist to this story, and I found the peek into the inner workings of a college football team fascinating. If you want a well-written, fresh college romance, without unrealistic and unecessary drama, pick up JOCKBLOCKED. It is part of an internconnected series but can defintely be read as a standalone. And be prepared for Matty to steal your heart!!   He watches me while I pull on my coat. ""You're right that there's nothing wrong with how you're living. I'm not judging that. I'm just saying maybe your life could be happier. And that sometimes taking a risk gives you big rewards.""   ""And you're that big reward?""   He smiles wide. ""You won't know unless you give me a try.""   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
430	adjudicated	average	"6 stars. Absolute perfection!!   Seriously, how can I even begin to discuss a book that has shot to the top of my list of favorite books ever? Colleen Hoover has written another magical, perfect story that will grab your heartstrings and will not let go until the very end. I have to make this review intentionally vague because there is a major plot twist in Maybe Someday that must be experienced first-hand and should not be known before you start reading this book.   ""Sometimes in life, we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective.""   Truer words were never spoken. Sydney and Ridge's story was like nothing I have read before. And Maybe Someday is SO much more than just a book, there is a gorgeous soundtrack that accompanies the story and makes this an unforgettable reading and listening experience.   Ridge is hands-down my new favorite book boyfriend. Ms. Hoover has taken a familiar genre, and created an imaginative and unexpected story that surprised and thrilled me and left me with a serious book hangover after finishing. This book is perfection and it is an absolute must-read!!   (ARC obtained from NetGalley)"

172	adjudicated	excellent	"It's always been you, and no one else.   WOW!! What a passionate, emotional and sexy story! Love, betrayal, loyalty, forgiveness...this book has it all!! I couldn't put this one down!! I absolutely love enemies-to-lovers books, especially where there is an element of revenge. Plus, I adore Mia Sheridan's writing so I could not wait to read this book. And I will admit I do sometimes judge a book by its cover, and this cover is STUNNING. So there's that.   I immediately connected with these beautifully flawed and damaged characters. Their pain, suffering, humiliation and pride broke my heart and Mia Sheridan put it back together again. While Lydia could have been a cookie-cutter, snobby heroine, she instead came across as loyal, loving and willing to admit to her past mistakes. And they were HUGE. A stupid and cruel act when she was a teenager led to a domino effect of tragic consequences for Brogan Ramsay and his family. And now he is back in Lydia's life, hell-bent on getting revenge for the pain she caused him all those years before.   ""Learn from you mistakes, but don't let them define you now. Find forgiveness, for them and for yourself.""   Watching Lydia and Brogan slowly make their way back into each other's lives was painful, raw and breathtaking. So much drama and heartache separated these two that I lost thought they would never find their way back. There is an element of romantic suspense here which Mia Sheridan got just right. And the cast of supporting characters are all fabulous. (Fionn!! HELLO!!) Are there some pieces that don't quite fit together? Yes, but they are non-essential to the story and the characters are so strong that they swept me away. I was lost in this book and savored every minute of it.   Brogan Ramsay had come from Ireland with his family and I loved how the author incorporated Gaelic throughout the book. What a beautiful and descriptive language! Ms. Sheridan's books always leave a lasting impression and Ramsay is no different. I am still thinking about the characters well after I finished this book. I fell in love with Ramsay Brogan and although he has't quite replaced Archer as my favorite Mia Sheridan hero, he comes close! Don't miss Ramsay, you will fall i love with these characters, too.   ""There is such as thin veil between love and hate. I had chosen love."""
99	adjudicated	good	"Such a sweet and sexy story! Highly recommend this one for fans of KA - this book is all about a strong heroine; a stand-up, Alpha hero; and some fast-moving danger. Loved the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana scenery.   I'm a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly. This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick, Jesse's friend. (This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!) It's no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline (Emmy) were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise! They meet up again very unexpectedly after many years apart, when she moves to his small town.   ""Nick?"" Gigi asked, but I didn't speak or take my eyes off Emmy. She was frozen just like I was. Finally, Emmy broke away.   ""Sorry. I have to go,"" she mumbled before racing to the door.   ""What was that? Do you know her?"" Jess asked.   Yeah. I knew her. ""She's my wife.""   There is a delicious slow-burn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married. Emmy now has a boyfriend, and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing (there's a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!). Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas. Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds, but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott, Montana.   Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures. Even though they are husband and wife, they really didn't know each other at all. If you are a fan of small-town romance, you will love this book. There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat. Although story did not have the ""wow"" factor that 'The Coppersmith Farmhouse' had, I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters.   I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait for more stories about the other characters. Ms. Perry obviously has a great deal of love for her setting and it shows in her writing. 'The Clover Chapel' is a heart-warming, funny, sexy and very adult romance that enthralled me and entertained me to the very last word. I am thrilled that the third book in the series, 'The Lucky Heart' is coming in August! I can't wait to return to Jamison Valley.   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
293	adjudicated	poor	"Well this is a book that has some controversy surrounding it, of which I was blissfully unaware until I read a warning that came with this ARC. There are lots of reviewers who refuse to read this book, and that's fine. But based on its merits, I enjoyed this MM romance that comes with a healthy dose of sarcasm.   Black Balled is a fairly quick read and is a parody of the indie book world, pairing a snarky book reviewer with tons of anxieties with an author who has tons of anger issues. The authors did a great job at the dual POV and really, when you peel away the layers of sarcasm and humor, the story is about finding yourself.   ""Larson knows who he is and he makes no excuses or apologies for it. He wears his flaws just as proudly as he does his attributes, for all to see, and for everyone to accept or reject-as the case may be because it makes no difference to him. He is comfortable in his own skin. That is probably because Larson is genuine. He doesn't wear layers of facades that need to be ripped away in order to find his inner soul; or his truth. He just puts it all out there without reservation.   Not like me.""   There is lots and lots of white-hot sex in this book and tons of great banter. If you go into Black Balled knowing it has a very different storyline, and that both characters have a wicked sense of humor, then you'll love this book!"
216	adjudicated	average	"Absolutely astounding!!!! And the end was perfection.   HIDDEN BODIES begins where where YOU ended. For those of you who do not like cliffies, YOU wasn't really a cliffhanger and can absolutely be read as a standalone. However, for someone like me who is obsessed with Joe Goldberg (and a little bit in love with him? Weird, I know), I was thrilled that there was more to this story.   As funny as the author's commentary on NYC life was, she is even funnier and more on-point with her look at living in L.A. Don't fear, Joe is still as crazy as ever, but in an almost ""Being There"" fashion, everyone around him seems to mold him into what they believe him to be.   And Joe is trying. He really is. But is still a complete and total sociopath. Despite that, I was really rooting for him to find true love in HIDDEN BODIES. But everyone is just so phony and materialistic and so Joe really believes he is justified in his actions. This story is just as addictive and readable as YOU, and will keep you on the edge of your seat, terrified but yet laughing out loud. Scary, funny, heartbreaking and amazing. Congrats to Caroline Kepnes for another perfect book.   (Thanks to Atria for a review copy.)"

It really dove into what it's like to be in the spy world. A world where, as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel, the only rule is to do what's best for your country. When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window. Murder, traitorism, disloyalty - are all ok in the name of great good. And operatives who live in this world have a hard time ""coming in from the cold"" - as did Laemas.   The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive. He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic, start sucking at his job, ostracize all his friends and anyone he met, and hit total rock bottom, until he was thrown in jail. That's impressive. Not something I think most people could do - which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one.   The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz (Laemas' love interest)'s main issue with the events. But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle - though people were killed in the end it was a win for London, after all. It was interesting that the last lines of the novel had him thinking about some kids he almost ran over in his car once: as though he wanted to get back to that place where normal rules applied."
48	adjudicated	average	Loved every second, and didn't want it to end, so I had to find a book store and buy the next two! Its a Harry Potter reading level and similar type fantasy story, but sometimes thats what you need on a long flight to NYC for the holidays!   I think as a child we all daydreamed about alternate worlds, so I love how thats the basis for the book. Thinking about all the permutations of how things could turn out differently is kinda fun :) I think if I had a Daemon I would hope she'd settle on being a lynx.
33	adjudicated	average	"** spoiler alert **   Critics aside, Dan Brown can sure write a thriller. I was stuck in an airport with no book and picked this up, and was done with it in 2 days.   The first half of the book was really gripping, and promised big things. We were going to learn about the secrets of the Masons, and about the ""ancient wisdom"" that has been lost through the ages. Sounds cool - I wanted to learn more about the ancient wisdom. But the end of the book just fell really flat. The villian was predictable, and we learned nothing about this ancient wisdom.   I also have to say that I almost fell out of bed laughing with Dan Brown plugged Twitter at the end of the book. To be fair, he's right - people are excited about Twitter because it (along with many other websites) is helping cause a shift in our society. But I can't help wondering if 5 years from now, when Twitter is MySpace, people will read that and think ""wtf?""."

I adored this tortured tale of Low and Poesy, two star-crossed lovers who spend much of the book on the run from the authorities after a string of bank robberies. It is a tribute to the talent of Mary Elizabeth that you actually feel tremendous sympathy for Low, the poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks whose life seems doomed from the first page.   Low has the misfortune to have a criminal for a father and to be dirt-poor. A petty crime lands him in prison with hardened criminals who teach him how to rob banks. When he is released, he tries desperately to live on the right side of the law. But poverty, hunger and sheer desperation drive him to a string of crimes, with the loyal Poesy right by his side. She is absolutely devoted to him.   ""I'm here,"" she chose in a for-sure tone. ""We did this together, and anything we do together is right, Low.""   I spent most of this book on the edge of my seat, in a constant state of anxiety for the handsome, sad Low and his beautiful Poesy. He is desperate to live a simple, normal life. Low is not at all greedy, but he just wants to be able to eat, help Poesy with school and help his own family. They seem doomed from the start but they overcome so many obstacles that I was cheering for them throughout the book.   LOW is a fast-paced, very gritty story that is incredibly addictive. This was my first book by Mary Elizabeth and I am in love with her writing style!! I loved LOW and I hope for more about these two unforgettable characters.   Favorite quote:   ""I can't be anywhere else other than with you, Lowen,"" she says softly. ""No matter what happens, we have to stay together.""

328	adjudicated	good	I can't say much about this book because I don't want to give the plot away but I was completely and totally immersed once again in the world of the Weavers and the Hawks!! This book has a little bit of a different tone to it than the previous books because there are lots of questions that are answered. This series is EPIC!! (And I would LOVE to see it made into a mini-series.) I'm in denial that there is only one more book left in this series! I don't know how Ms. Winters dreams up these plots, but I'm glad she has such an incredibly vivid imagination and I can't wait for the next book in the Weaver/Hawk family saga.
201	adjudicated	good	"4.5 STARS!!!   ""Falling in love might not have been on my list...but I'm glad I fell in love with you, Liam.""   I read this witty, funny, SEXXXXY, beautiful story in one sitting. Do NOT let the title scare you away! The Ending I Want is a very positive story in many ways, even though the plot is pretty much revealed early on in the book. Samantha Towle is such a capable writer that this story could have turned into a tired cliche. Instead, it is an exciting, fast-paced, immensely enjoyable book with two very memorable main characters.   Can we talk about Liam? At first I thought, ""Oh no, not another wealthy British businessman!"" But he is warm, smart, sensitive and ALPHA all rolled up into one perfect package. The problem is that Taylor Shaw only has plans to visit England for two very short weeks. Which means that she might have to tell Liam about the secret that she is trying not-so-successly to hide from him.   ""I would have stayed because I'm pretty sure I was in love with you from the moment you surprise-kissed me on the plane. You had me instantly.""   The Ending I Want is not overly-sentimental or sappy. Instead it is the perfect mix of humor, hope and love. I absolutely loved this unexpectedly beautiful story. Oh, and The Mighty Storm fans - watch for an appearance by Jake Wethers!!   Favorite Quote:   ""I'm smiling and laughing and doing something that scares the crap out of me. I'm living because of Liam. And that thought alone brings with it a whole new brand of fear in me. A fear that terrifies me in a way that I have never known before.""

447	adjudicated	excellent	"BLACK IRIS is a powerful and shockingly different book that kept me up reading all night. Leah Raeder's fierce and descriptive prose is poetic and gripping and pulled at all my emotions.   This is a stunning tale of mental illness, love, adolescent angst, sexuality, revenge and finally, self-acceptance. Laney is the voice of the story and she is not the most lovable of characters. Yes, her tale is sad and depressing at first but ultimately it is uplifting in a way that only Leah Raeder can make honest, real, believable and sympathetic all at once.   ""Tell me something."" He leaned closer, his voice raspy at the edges, charred. ""If you hate human connection so much, why come with us?"" Because I don't hate it. I hate how much I need it. Because you're the ones I was waiting for. Because you smell like prey.""   Unteachable is one of my favorite books so I could not wait to read BLACK IRIS. And Leah Raeder has written another powerful and brilliant story that will keep you guessing until the very end. It is not told in chronological order, which adds to the element of disorientation present throughout the book. Her writing style is beautiful, seductive and addicting, a world where wet eyelashes become black petals and a lowly puddle of water becomes a brilliant oil color painting.   The characters in this book are unforgettable and I felt as though I personally knew Delaney, Blythe, Armin, Donnie and Hiyam. The writer is wise beyond her years and her glimpses into married life are brutally honest and painful and will haunt me for a long time to come. The plot is incredibly imaginative and meaningful and is not all hearts and flowers. If you are looking for a thrilling, suspenseful book with a powerful message and perfect writing, then read BLACK IRIS. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truly a one-of-kind story from an author with a very unique voice.   Change isn't peaceful. Change is violent, savage, cruel.   (ARC provided by the publisher with thanks.)"

This review will be very vague on details because Bang absolutely must be read without any spoilers - this story will simply take you on a wild roller coaster ride from start to finish.   All of these author's books are beautifully written but in my opinion, Bang is the best book she has written so far. I don't know where she dreamed up this storyline from, but it is gripping, erotic, gut-wrenching, suspenseful and incredibly creative all at once. I fell in love with all of the characters, and was blown away by the fantastic story.   Bang is an absolute must-read! It is highly erotic and very, very dark. And yes, the ending will totally leave you guessing as to what happens next. I miss these characters and can't wait for the next book in this series!

231	adjudicated	average	2.5 - 3 Stars   As much I loved CRAZY GOOD, the debut book from this author, I am not quite sure what to make of this latest book. CRAZY GOOD was a sexy, refreshing, very readable story with an unforgettable Alpha and it was exciting to read a new author. Unfortunately, TIME AND SPACE did not work for me at all. There is a dramatic, totally unbelievable plot twist literally dropped into the story with zero explanation or set-up. Added to the large number of editing and grammar issues, I'm afraid this just wasn't for me. Perhaps some editing next time around will help. I will definitely give this author a try again but this whole book was just a giant puzzle to me.
261	adjudicated	good	Well, hmmmm. Although lots of readers raved about this story, it just didn't work for me on many levels. I can live with instalove and instalust, but the main characters got together way too early in the story for me to feel any connection between them whatsoever. The storyline is clever and could have made a good book, but there was just too much thrown in to create any real depth to the characters or to the situations. There is a major plot twist at the end that is just completely and utterly unbelievable. I give the author credit for some interesting ideas, but this book is in need of a good editor. Also there is a wrong word that is used during a crucial scene that hopefully was fixed in the final version. I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that is was because if not, it completely changed the tone of the scene. ( Usually I purchase the finished book but I didn't in this case.) So take a look at all the positive reviews, and give is one a try if you think it's for you!
289	adjudicated	good	"5 Sexy and Edgy Stars!!   ""Even the best of us isn't purely good. And even the worst of us isn't purely evil.""   This book is pure PERFECTION. My thought when finishing was, ""Now what do I read?!"" This is one of my top favorite series EVER. I am truly obsessed with this author and this story. Jonah and Vivienne are incredibly written characters, filled with depth and raw emotion. This is a very adult story, dealing with very adult subjects. With that said, these book are among the most highly erotic stories I have ever read.   This series is not for everyone, but if you like sexy, edgy, mature stories, then definitely give these books a try. Lilah Pace's writing captivated me and drew me into Jonah and Vivienne's story like very few authors can do. While the subject may seem very taboo, I found these books to be as much an exploration of women's sexuality as they are ""forbidden"" erotic romance. These stories take you on an emotional journey that is sensual, enthralling and addictive, to say the least.   BEGGING FOR IT is the conclusion to the series and picks up right where the first book ended. They must be read in order. These two characters are absolutely unforgettable, and I could not really fathom how they were going to make their very unorthodox relationship work. Jonah struggles with his own seemingly-insurmountable dark fantasies, while Vivienne also struggles to come to terms with her own deep-seated fears, as well as her very dysfunctional family. I literally raced through this book, fearful that the author was not going to give these two perfectly damaged souls the conclusion they were worthy of. I felt tremendous empathy for both of these characters and was deeply satisfied with the fantastic conclusion to their stories. I can't say enough about these books. They are thought-provoking, emotional and incredibly readable.   ""We don't get better; we don't fix everything that's broken. We just learn how to work around the broken bits. How to do the best we can with what we have, and who we are.""   I am completely OBSESSED with this author and cannot wait for whatever books she might have planned for the future. I hope there are more books under the name Lilah Pace - I will read anything she writes!   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"
163	adjudicated	good	"3.5 Stars   If you like lots of high school drama, then this book is for you! Broken Prince reminded me of Gossip Girl in many ways. However, the over-the-top cruelty of Reed and Ella's fellow students here turned me off. The main characters have lots of promise, and I really loved Reed and Ella. Many readers love this series, so I am in the minority on this one and definitely pick this one up if you are in the mood for a guilty-pleasure read!   ""He told me to stay away. He told me I didn't belong. If only I'd listened to him.""   The first book ended on a major cliffhanger and in this second installment, former mean-boy Reed is desperate to find Ella. She has brought happiness and goodness to his royally-screwed up family and he will do anything to bring her home and win back her love. BUT there are SO many obstacles standing in their way!   ""I can play this two ways. I can walk away. Or I can fight for you. Guess which one I'm doing?""   This is very quick read and a very fast-paced story. The writing duo that makes up Erin Watt are incredibly talented, and I love their other books. If you know going in to Broken Prince that this is basically a teen soap-opera, then you will LOVE this juicy bit of fluff. But be warned: there is another cliffhanger!   I did love reading Reed's POV in this book. I felt his pain and the pressure he was under to try and protect the innocent Ella at all costs. I also loved the VERRRRY sexy Royal brothers!! There was just way too much unnecessary over-the-top drama for me. But if you are looking for a summer pool or beach read, then pick up Broken Prince and enjoy the crazy ride!

426	adjudicated	average	"5 Time-Is-Precious-Stars!!   I have a confession to make: I read this book a while ago and have simmered over what I could possibly write that would do justice to this unexpectedly sexy, warm-hearted and funny story. Slow Burn was nothing that I expected from Ms. Bromberg, and it totally took me by surprise and blew me away!!   Ah, Becks and Haddie. If you think you know them from the Driven Trilogy, you will see them in a whole new light in Slow Burn. With that being said, this book can absolutely be read and enjoyed as a standalone. Becks and Haddie had one night together and he knows in his heart that he won't be able to stay away from Haddie, even though she presents a tough-as-nails exterior to the world. He sees the real her. I read this book literally on the edge of my seat and I have never appreciated Ms. Bromberg's brand of humor more!   Favorite quotes:   ""Time is precious. Waste it wisely.""   ""I just figured you were having some regression pussy.""   ""Whenever I don't want to deal..., I go and have meaningless sex to not think about it. 'Slut glut, I believe is my term for it.""   ""Slow burn, my ass. More like fire in the goddamn hole.""   ""Goddmann estrogen vortex.""   Slow Burn will make you laugh, cry and SWOON. It's a must-read and is destined to become another beloved contemporary romance from K. Bromberg."

'Mr. President' is a feel-good story set against the exciting backdrop of America's capitol. With the U.S. election season almost at an end, we all can use a good old-fashioned political romance!   Matt and Charlotte were both born into political families. Charlotte is the daughter of a senator and Matt is the son of a former U.S. president. Their futures seem pre-destined. But Charlotte is not sure what she wants to do with her life, until a promise she made as a child now comes back to life. She had promised Matt that if he ever ran for president, that she would join his campaign. Now fast-forward to the present day and a young and very promising Matt is running for president as an independent candidate.   He is very passionate about changing the world. Charlotte, who worked for her mother's organization assisting women in need, is totally captivated by him and can't hep but be mesmerized by him. This is a political campaign so Matt's every move is being watched. Charlotte is a campaign staffer. Will they ever be able to go public with their very passionate romance?   I loved that this book had a very upbeat and positive spin on American politics. Ms. Evans seems to have really done her homework on the inner workings of political campaigns and it really shows. Matt and Charlotte had amazing chemistry together, even though this story was a slow-burn romance. It does conclude on a bit of a cliffhanger but the next book in the series will be releasing very soon, in January 2017. I can't wait to see how Matt and Charlotte's romance plays out.   ""We're a perfect couple, in the most imperfect situation.""   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"

136	adjudicated	good	"4.5 Stars!   ""I'm good at being what people want me to be. Watch me . . . You'll see.""   In this smart and very engaging mystery, we're treated to three different perspectives on a crime that occurs very early on in the book. Hattie is a good girl, having grown up in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. She aches to break free and move to New York City after high school. Hattie is the perfect daughter, student, girlfriend and friend.   But Hattie has a secret life, one that threatens the delicate balance of her small Minnesota farming town. She is merely pretending, acting a role, when the ""real"" Hattie is far from perfect. Her actions will affect and change many people's lives forever. Peter is her high school English teacher who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. And Del is the lead investigator on Hattie's brutal murder. His voice lends a dry wit and careful reason to the series of events unfolding around him. Can he be neutral when the families he has known his whole life are brutally affected by this unspeakable crime?   ""Mom warned me that I had a lot to learn about the world. I wished she would've mentioned how much the learning was going to hurt.""   I was enthralled by this deeply moving thriller! The small-town atmosphere is perfectly captured by the author. Every characters is flawed, some more so than others. I never saw the ending coming. This book was fast-paced, smart and engaging. Don't be put off by the endless comparisons to other best-sellers in this genre. 'Everything You Want Me to Be' stands on its own as a poignant and suspenseful story. Highly recommended for all fans of psychological thrillers and murder mysteries!   ""You can't live your life acting for other people. Other people will just use you up.

Mariana Zapata, where have you been all my life!? 'Wait for It' was completely engrossing; a slow-burn romance that really ignited my passion for reading again. And now I must decide which one of her books to read next! This was my first book by this amazing author, and I absolutely adored every single word of this incredible story!   'Wait for It' is not a predictable story. It is a solid, real, passionate romance, filled with heart and humor and heart-stopping love. Diana is single and raising two young boys. She is independent, funny, hard-working and definitely NOT looking for romance.   She meets her new neighbor Dallas in a very unconventional way, and they actually get off to a very rocky start. Dallas is stern, uptight and seems to not like Diana very much AT ALL.   What were you supposed to do when someone didn't want to be your friend or at least be friendly, and you'd tried your best? I thought I'd been a pretty good person. A pretty good neighbor. I hadn't done anything to make him feel uncomfortable. At least, I genuinely didn't think I had.   Diana oh-so-slowly begins to realize what kind of man Dallas really is when he becomes the coach of her young boy's baseball team. Between baseball and being neighbors, Dallas begins to form a bond with Diana and her family that biomes the real backbone of this story.   He has a soft spot for single moms. You are no one special, Diana, I reminded myself. You are no one special.   Mariana Zapata's writing is so unique and fresh that I am going to pick up one of her other books next. I could not get enough of Dallas and Diana! The dialogue was snappy and felt SO real. The character development was strong and the romance unfolded perfectly. No insta-love here, folks. This couple built a solid foundation so that when they eventually got together, it was simply beautiful.   'Wait for It"" was the kind of book that I simply could not wait to get back to. Isn't that the best kind of story? If you are looking for a passionate story about two grown-ups who have lived and loved and lost, then pick up this book. It is gorgeous.   ""She wouldn't be my first, but she'd be the only one who ever mattered. I think she could wait for the time to be right. I'd make sure she never regretted it."""

Gritty, sexy, rough, heartbreaking, but uplifting and yes, romantic, Abby and Jake will get under your skin, and you won't soon forget them. Abby has had a hard-knock life and is beaten down at every turn. Jake is sexy and dangerous but there's a lot more to him than meets the eye. These two battle almost insurmountable odds and the author's writing will keep you frantically turning the pages until you finish. Loved the conclusion to this book. I adore this author and can't wait for her next book, King.   (Photo courtesy of the author)
9	adjudicated	good	"Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson. I really enjoyed this book - mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI, but also to learn about the history of the time. How America entered the war, the importance of shipping to England, the ruthlessness and autonomy of German u-boat commanders. Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info (though he overdid it too a little bit).   One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk, to help draw America into the war. His conclusion seems to be that was the case, though there isn't conclusive evidence. Before the Lusitania sank, very few Americans had died in the war, and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank, which definitely helped change America's attitude. And even then, it took 2 years after it sank for America's troops to arrive.   ""the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war.""   Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a u-boat in WW1. For instance:   ""In this day before sonar, a submarine traveled utterly blind, trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts. One great fear of all U-boat men was that a half-sunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path.""   Which is crazy! Plus, the torpedoes weigh 3 thousand pounds each, so a boat could only carry ~7, and their failure rate was something like 60%. Also, they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time. Given all this, trying to operate a u-boat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess. But they certainly had an effect on the war - at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in 3 months if it didn't get more supplies.   There were a lot of interesting details from the era that Larson wove in that was interesting as well. Stuff like the fact that Ouija boards were commonplace in American households, straw hat day.   My main critique is that it had a few too many irrelevant details - about various passengers or what happened the day the boat left dock - and stuff like that - felt a bit padded in that respect. But overall, a great read."
327	adjudicated	average	3.5 Stars!!   Tessa and Luke. They absolutely can't stand each other...but really they are perfect for each other! All I Want is the second book in the Alabama Summer series and can be read as a standalone although it is recommended that you read Book #1 first. I have not read the first book and I still loved this second installment in the series. The sex is HOT, the attraction undeniable and the story fast-apced and gripping! Tessa and Luke are two incredibly stubborn people who just can't seem to stop torturing each other. Tessa broke up with Luke for what she thought was good reason (if a little misguided) and while he can't forgive her, he also can't seem to stay away from her, either.   I'm a sucker for a hot Alpha in a uniform and Luke is one protective, sexy cop. He has a very, very painful family life, one that he hides from Tessa, much to her dismay. Despite her initial resentment of Luke, and jealousy over his random hook-ups, she really wants to be there for him emotionally.   Much of this book is spent with these two fighting and then having scorching hot sex. J. Daniels can really write a super-hot, sexy and fast-paced read that will keep you very entertained. This book is as lighthearted as some of her other books but it is very enjoyable and I recommend it for fans of second-chance romance and super-hot, sexy, Southern Alphas who won't take no for an answer! And not to fear, these two have a HEA, even after all of their emotional ups and downs. And I can't wait for the next book in this series, Reed! Bring it on!
464	adjudicated	excellent	4.5 stars!! If you are a fan of intense psychological thrillers, do not miss this last installment of the Evan Arden Trilogy! Evan is a shell of a man, he thinks he's unloveable and he suffers terribly from painful memories of his past. Lia might be his savior and he will do anything to protect her. The storyline is incredibly creative, and the steam factor is off the charts!   This is a real page-turner, a true romantic suspense story. There are some memorable (and dangerous) characters here and Ms. Savage kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading this book. I loved the completely unpredictable plot and absolutely loved the chemistry between Evan and Lia! I highly recommend this book and series when you crave some major suspense and need a departure from a hearts-and-flowers story. Evan is an amazing character, and the writing is top-notch. I am glad I got to know Evan Arden!   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
65	adjudicated	average	"** spoiler alert **   This book may as well have been called One Hundred Years of Inbreeding And Human Drama. It was basically a story about a small town where the gene pool is so small that everyone marries their relations, and it seems like life spirals more and more downward and out of control over 100 years. I really enjoyed the authors ability to bring these crazy characters to life, and explain the story behind how each one's quirks strange behavior. The book started out really strong, stagnated a bit for me 2/3 of the way in, but I loved the ending.   I also thought the inclusion of magical elements throughout the story was an interesting and fun twist. Melquiades's scrolls, the floating priest, etc. According to Wikipedia this is called ""magical realism"". Thinking about all the movies and TV shows being produced now, it seems that this is a common plot element nowadays!"
301	adjudicated	average	"I do LOVE my Katy Evans books!! MANWHORE +1 was a wonderful and very satisfying sequel to the first book in the series, Manwhore! I loved the very modern and witty yet very sexy story.   This book picks up right after the conclusion to MANWHORE. Rachel has publicly embarrassed her boyfriend Malcolm Saint and is in deep despair of ever repairing their relationship. Katy Evans writes a beautifully flowing yet very fast-paced and verrrrry sexy story here as we experience the deep heartache that Rachel feels.   ""This is what I've been waiting for, for four weeks. This is what I wanted when I left a thousand messages on his phones and what I wanted when I wrote a thousand others that I left unsent. To see him.   For him to want to see me.""   There's plenty of office drama, too, as Rachel's dream job seems to be in jeopardy due to a bidding war over the ownership of the company where she works. One of the things I love about this author is that her heroes, no matter how tortured, always have the ability the love deeply and Saint is no exception. Despite his reputation, he really cares deeply for Rachel and their scenes together are perfect.   I definitely recommend this series if you love a contemporary, witty, and passionate story with a great cast of supporting players. I also loved that there might be another story here for Gina and Tahoe? Things seem to be pointing in that direction and I would love to read more about them! I can't wait to see what's next for Rachel and Saint and am anxiously awaiting Ms. Manwhore!   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"
15	adjudicated	good	"A classic dystopian novel published in 1985, but still very relevant - and even trending in 2017 due to the political climate. I liked how it unfolded - we learn about the state of the world and what has happened to it very piecemeal throughout the book, and I think if Atwood had just described it all up front it wouldn't have been nearly as compelling.   This book seems to be a kind of warning. It describes a future state that is chilling and depressing, and yet (to the point) chillingly possible. It describes a society that has - for reasons we never quite learn (but might have to do with radiation or sterilization?) remade itself from one where everyone has basic freedom and choice, to one that is the opposite of that. Pleasure, poverty, and other evils are eliminated in this system. And most chillingly, women have almost no rights. The books main character is a ""hand maiden"" who's only role is to bear children from the person who seems to have purchased/acquired her for that purpose. She doesn't even have a proper name anymore - she is called ""Offred"" because she is the property ""of Fred"".   ""We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice.""   A lot of the book explores themes like the above - what it would be like to take away basic freedoms, choices, and also ability to have relationships with others. Chilling and depressing, because so much of what we value in modern society is our freedom. And yet, we do know that too much choice does paralyze, and many people want leaders and situations that simplify the decisions they have to make. This might sound like a balance, but its not, because our ability to make choice, especially bad choices, is actually crucial to our development.   ""Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some.""   This was an insightful sentence, because it implied the commander thought they were making society better, not worse, overall. And yet clearly for everyone in the book - including the commander - it doesn't sound better. Did they just miss the mark? Was it a big experiment gone wrong? Regardless, in todays world this sentence is perhaps most applicable:   ""We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it. Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it."""
157	adjudicated	average	I adore Alexa Riley, I really do! Their short stories are my not-so-secret addiction. I think I've bought every one of them! 'Mechanic' is one of my favorites. So I was very excited to read their first full-length book. Unfortunately this story just didn't do it for me. The overly-possessive, controlling and bossy hero didn't even bother me at all; in fact he's a part of this writing duo's charm! Oz knew what he wanted and he went after her. What bothered me was that the heroine was a Yale grad but she sure didn't act like one. In addition, I had several issues with the plot which sadly interfered with my enjoyment of the story. And when did Nordstrom come to Manhattan? (Answer: it didn't. Nordstrom Rack doesn't count.) I'll continue to buy and read Alexa Riley's books, but this one was a miss for me.
41	adjudicated	average	I read this after hearing from a few people that it was among their all-time favorites. I was almost put off when I saw it was a story about rabbits, originally written as a tale by a father to his children - but I'm glad I wasn't.   I found the folk tales about El-ahrairah to be very impressive. The author clearly had a vivid imagination to create so much of the rabbits culture and history. But I think this book was worth reading as it's really a story about survival, leadership, and human nature.   Oh and Fiver rocks. And BigWig is the man.
380	adjudicated	good	"First, I was very pleasantly suprised at the steam factor in this book! And Thomas Maddox is a memorable character, that's for sure.   I really liked the romantic suspense aspect of this story, and I really admire the author for writing a strong female character. Oh look, it's okay to be a workaholic and be a professional! I am on board with female characters who are not just window-dressing or who do nothing but sorrt of flit around the story. But I digress.   Liis and Thomas do connect early on, but it really works in this book. Jamie can really write a steamy hot sex scene and I can't wait to read more of this from her!Liis is smart but she is pretty insecure in her personal life.   I'd gone from feeling sexy and desired to an embarassingly eager, cheap score.   Liis and Thomas must later work together as FBI agents and this aspect of the story was very fast-paced and interesting. Liis, like Thomas, is devoted to her work which has not left much time for a personal life.   ""Ah. You're married to the job. Betty Bureau.""   Thomas is a total hard-ass and has a notorious reputation for being impossible to work for. Will he soften for Liis? I loved seeing the other Maddox brothers make an appearance here, but make no mistake, this was Thomas' story through and through. This book is fast-paced, sexy, very romantic and a must-read for Jamie McGuire fans.   Favorite quote:   ""You can love someone without wanting to be with them. Just like you can want to be with someone before you love then.""   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)"
469	adjudicated	average	The Hard Ink Series by Laura Kaye is a thrilling and super-sexy series! I loved the first book As Hard As It Get, and Hard As You Can delivers another romantic suspense story with Shane and Crystal. Their story begins almost immediately after the first book. They both have suffered terribly, in different ways. Crystal is a waitress at a strip club, paying off an old debt while taking care of her special needs sister. Shane is a protective former Special Forces Officer who is intrigued by Crystal and wants nothing more than to take care of her.   These two are dealing with some very tough circumstances, to put it mildly. There is a pretty detailed backstory in Hard As It Gets that might be helpful to read before Shane and Crystal's book to give you a sense of the characters and their relationship to each other. I absolutely loved the sexy scenes between Shane and Crystal and the twists and turns that Laura Kaye does so well. If you like super hot military men and a steamy story with some mystery and intrigue thrown in, than Hard As You Can is for you!   (ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review)
404	adjudicated	good	"4.5 Stars - very very addictive - really loved Naz, in all his dark and tortured glory. He is my favorite part of this story and is a very, very complex character. For all of his very, very bad equalities, and there are many, he really loves Karissa and will let nothing stand in the way of keeping her safe. This is a very twisty story that begins in Book #1 and is part intense love story and part suspense story.   Torture to Her Soul was a tiny bit slow for me midway through the story only because I have such high esteem for J.D. Darhower and her storytelling abilities. But the characters and the story are really fantastic and Mafia romances are one of my favorites genres. So I completely loved Naz, even when I hated him.   This entire story is solely from Naz's POV and is a fascinating look inside his very dark mind. I could not wait for this conclusion to the incredible story from Monster in His Eyes and it did not disappoint. A must-read for all fans of darker romance.   Favorite quote:   ""I'm not a good man,"" he says, ""but I'm trying. I'm trying. I can't make you any promises of perfection. I can't promise I'll be what you deserve, or what you need, or even what you always want. All I can promise is that I'll love you until the day I die, and I'll spend every moment I'm alive trying for you.""   *ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review."
217	adjudicated	excellent	"In the depraved innards of my soul, I thrill at being the thing she fears. I want to claim her apprehension, dread, and uncertainty. I want to take ownership of all of her emotions and be the sole reason she trembles and cries.   With those words, Pam Godwin has written on my favorite student-teacher dark romances. DARK NOTES is in the same category as UNTEACHABLE by Leah Raeder, with the rapid, short sentence style and the hopeless, yet hopeful, heroine. But Mr. Emeric Marceaux in in a class by himself (pun intended!) with his dark, dangerous and commanding nature. He knows what he wants and will do anything to make that happen.   Ivory is a feisty, but dirt-poor music student who is out of her element at the expensive and elitist music school she attends. She is a senior and is trying desperately to make it to graduation so that she can secure a spot at a prestigious music academy. But she is the poorest student at the school, forced to do anything to survive. She barely has money for new shoes or the school uniform, let alone textbooks or the required tablet.   Emeric is one commanding and bossy man. Whew. I thought I knew what I was getting into with this book but my God, this man is irresistible. He never, ever mistreats Ivory, unlike most of the other men in her life, and his heart literally aches for the proud student who refuses to take charity from anyone.   ""All you need is a moment...This brutal man is my home. His hell is my heaven. I'm his Ivory, and he's my darkest note.""   Emeric became obsessed with Ivory and although he knew he had to stay away, they were both immediately connected and believe me, this girl needed his protection in the worst way. I love Emeric and was completely invested in him and his need to protect Ivory. This is without a doubt one of the sexiest forbidden love stories I've ever read.   There is a fantastic, brutal, emotional and violent storyline that is pure Pam Godwin. The New Orleans setting is perfection, and having lived there for many years, I am always thrilled when an author gets the setting of the story just right. New Orleans is almost another character in this book, with its humidity, class system, funky neighborhoods and diverse music scene.   Ivory is a feisty, strong heroine who will do whatever she needs to survive in her brutal world. She is no virginal, innocent heroine but she does have a refreshing honesty that I loved. Pam Godwin continues to be my go-to author for dark romance and DARK NOTES is just one more forbidden romance that hits all the right notes.

280	adjudicated	average	Russell. He is everything! Make Me serves up a healthy dose of steamy sex plus some really great comedic moments!   Although Book #3 in Tessa Bailey's Broke and Beautiful series, this scorching book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel and is sexy, FUNNY and fast-paced. MAKE ME is pure Tess Bailey gold! Abby and Russell's story is an enjoyable, delicious book, written as always in the trademark Tess Bailey style of dirty-talking Alphas with a healthy dose of reality, humor and solid storyline.   I was hooked from the hilarious opening line of this book. Russell is a blue-collar construction worker who thinks he will never be good enough for Abby, who comes from a wealthy family but is insanely attracted to Russell. She doesn't quite know how to move their friendship to the next level. Russell, on the other hand, fantasizes constantly about the irresistible Abby and is driven by the need to protect her. Will these two ever be able to move their relationship past the dreaded friend zone? Tessa Bailey writes some of the best growly, sexy Alpha heroes and Russell is no exception. As with all of Ms. Bailey's books, you will need to have a cold shower ready while reading MAKE ME, but the sexiness is mixed in with the perfect amount of extremely witty banter and memorable characters. I absolutely loved this book and highly recommend it for all fans of scorching hot New Adult contemporary romance!   (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)
435	adjudicated	excellent	"Love. What else is love, if not the power to destroy?   After Dark brings the fantastically addictive Night Owl trilogy to an incredibly satisfying conclusion. And what a finale it is! We are now witness to the somewhat ""normal"" living arrangements of Matt and Hannah as they return to real life after the tumultuous events of the first two books. Their relationship continues to be beautifully sexy, erotic and passionate. Make no mistake, After Dark is incredibly hot, dirty and lusty. Matt is irresistible! If not very maddening.   ""...little secrets are like water, but if water gets into a rock and freezes, it can break the rock.""   Hannah and Matt both struggle in After Dark to reach a level of closeness and honesty that is sometimes brutal to witness yet real, honest and emotional. I love how both Matt and Hannah have grown and matured over the course of the trilogy, without one false note. The plot in the final book is refreshing and a complete page-turner. I will admit that I am distraught that this trilogy has ended (one of my all-time favorites, hands down), but I was absolutely entranced by the conclusion and the Epilogue. After Dark is a moody, erotic, sensual story that is a must-read book. Fingers crossed for many more books from the extraordinarily talented M. Pierce!   (ARC provided by the publisher with thanks.)"
431	adjudicated	good	"4.5 stars   Wow! A true m/m contemporary romance with two gorgeous, loving and confident men! I loved this book. I read a lot of m/m books and Always was a refreshingly different and wonderful story! I was hooked from the first glance between Avery and Kane and read this beautifully written book almost in one sitting.   Although I am not a fan of insta-love, the author handled the stunning attraction between Avery and Kane in a fantastic way in Always. Once these two met, there was no turning back.   ""Kane could feel his soul being extracted from his body. His heart followed, no longer his own, but given to this man he didn't even know. In a matter of a few short minutes, he had become one with this man in from of him.""   These two embark on a wonderful journey together and Ms. Alexander handles their lives with beauty and grace. Oh, and the sex scenes are absolutely some of the steamiest I have ever read. These two have a chemistry that jumps right off the page! I needed a cold shower after reading this book. I'll keep this review spoiler-free, because there are some major surprises that I did not see coming and this book should be read without knowing the plot twists.   Even if you are not a fan of the m/m contemporary romance genre, I highly recommend giving this book a try. It is lushly written and completely satisfying in terms of the emotional connection between the two main characters. I fell in love with Kane and Avery and I already miss them! I can't wait to read more of Kindle Alexander's books!"
338	adjudicated	excellent	"4.5 stars!!   Pam Godwin is at the top of my list of favorite authors. Her dark and thrilling stories are among my most treasured books so I was absolutely thrilled to read a copy of Dirty Ties. I loved the crime/thriller/revenge twists in this story. As with all of Ms. Godwin's books, the characters are engaging, the story is twisted, and the steam factor is completely off the charts.   Kaci is highly educated, hard working and a loyal wife to Collin. Their unconventional marriage has led to a lonely life for Kaci and she is desperately seeking the intimacy that is missing from with her husband. Her fascination with the underground racing circuit in Chicago leads her to the mysterious ""Evader"", a man who has plenty of secrets himself. These two become enmeshed in a dangerous game that will certainly leave one the of them broken.   I love how Ms. Godwin always writes very strong heroines who aren't afraid to go after what they want. Her women are determined, smart and driven, and Kaci is no different. She might have met her match with a sexy man she meets one night, and these two together were absolute magic!   ""She was a wild card, and that fucking terrified me.""   Lightening up this dark and sexy story are some humorous moments which were a welcome relief from the intense storyline. I especially loved Kaci and Collin's interactions and Kaci's internal debates, especially when it came to the hot new guy she meets:   ""What about me?"" The possessive hand on my thigh clenched. ""Are you interested?""   Oh, let me count the ways. And each one led to heartbreak.""   There were lots of twists and turns in this one! Loved the story. Dirty Ties is another great book from Pam Godwin!   (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"

208	adjudicated	good	"BEAUTIFUL AND PASSIONATE! Brigs and Natasha were in love once, and then a terrible tragedy struck and Brigs completely broke things off with Natasha. She was devastated. THE LIE is told in flashback, and we see the beginnings of their love story through the present day. This is a gorgeous second-chance romance, which had me on pins and needles from the first paragraph.   Brigs is a tortured soul and I wasn't quite sure how the author was going to bring him together with Natasha. She barely escaped their break-up with her sanity intact and can't even begin to think about him being in her life again. Everything about Brigs is simply too painful for Natasha to deal with.   ""Memories of love are a poison. My therapist told me that I have to embrace it. Acknowledge that people fall in love all the time with people they aren't supposed to, that I was swept away and lost control for once in my life...""   Brigs lives with crushing guilt for what happened to his family, but Natasha was the love of his life. What will he do now that she is in his life again? I was rooting for them from the beginning and read their story in one sitting. The writing is incredibly beautiful, soulful and passionate.   ""Tell me what I am to you,"" he whispers, leaning in closer. I suck in my breath. Afraid that if I exhale I'll let all my secrets loose.   I loved this book and loved the journey that Brigs and Natasha took in this story. THE LIE is yet another beautifully written story from Karina Halle!
